\fBbsub -E "\fRpre_exec_command [arguments ...]\fB"\fR
.SH Description

.sp 2
For a parallel job, the job-based pre-execution command runs on
the first host selected for the parallel job. If you want the
pre-execution command to run on a specific first execution host,
specify one or more first execution host candidates at the job
level using -m, at the queue level with \fBPRE_EXEC\fR in
lsb.queues, or at the application level with \fBPRE_EXEC\fR in
lsb.applications.
.sp 2
If the pre-execution command returns a zero (0) exit code, LSF
runs the job on the selected host. Otherwise, the job and its
associated pre-execution command goes back to PEND status and is
rescheduled. LSF keeps trying to run pre-execution commands and
pending jobs. After the pre-execution command runs successfully,
LSF runs the job. You must ensure that the pre-execution command
can run multiple times without causing side effects, such as
reserving the same resource more than once.
.sp 2
The standard input and output for the pre-execution command are
directed to the same files as the job. The pre-execution command
runs under the same user ID, environment, home, and working
directory as the job. If the pre-execution command is not in the
user\(aqs usual execution path (the $PATH variable), the full path
name of the command must be specified.
.sp 2
\fBNote: \fRThe command path can contain up to 4094 characters
for UNIX and Linux, or up to 255 characters for Windows,
including the directory and file name.

.sp 2
*  Check the SSH version on both hosts. If the hosts have
   different SSH versions, a message is displayed identifying a
   protocol version mismatch.
.sp 2
*  Check that public and private key pairs are correctly
   configured.

   $ ssh –f –L 6000:localhost:6000 domain_name date
.sp 2
If these commands return errors, troubleshoot the domain name
with the error information returned.

The job name does not need to be unique and can contain up to

.sp 2
To specify a job array, enclose the index list in square
brackets, as shown, and enclose the entire job array
specification in quotation marks, as shown. The index list is a
comma-separated list whose elements have the syntax
[start-end[:step]] where start, end and step are positive
integers. If the step is omitted, a step of one is assumed. By
default, the job array index starts at one.
.sp 2
By default, the maximum number of jobs in a job array is 1000,
which means the maximum size of a job array (that is, the maximum
job array index) can never exceed 1000 jobs.
.sp 2
To change the maximum job array value, set
\fBMAX_JOB_ARRAY_SIZE\fR in lsb.params to any positive integer
between 1 and 2147483646. The maximum number of jobs in a job
array cannot exceed the value set by \fBMAX_JOB_ARRAY_SIZE\fR.
.sp 2
You may also use a positive integer to specify the system-wide
job slot limit (the maximum number of jobs that can run at any
given time) for this job array.
.sp 2
All jobs in the array share the same job ID and parameters. Each
element of the array is distinguished by its array index.
.sp 2
After a job is submitted, you use the job name to identify the
job. Specify "\fIjob_ID\fR[\fIindex\fR]" to work with elements of
a particular array. Specify "\fIjob_name\fR[\fIindex\fR]" to work
with elements of all arrays with the same name. Since job names
are not unique, multiple job arrays may have the same name with a
different or same set of indices.

sends the message "\fRStarting on \fIexecution_host\fR\fR" when
the job starts running on the execution host.
.sp 2
You are not able to submit another job until the job is
completed. This is useful when completion of the job is required
to proceed, such as a job script. If the job needs to be rerun
due to transient failures, bsub returns after the job finishes
successfully. bsub exits with the same exit code as the job so
that job scripts can take appropriate actions based on the exit
codes. bsub exits with value 126 if the job was terminated while
pending.

.sp 2
By default, LSF sets a per-process (soft) memory limit for all
the processes that belong to the job. To set a hard memory limit,
specify an exclamation point (\fR!\fR) after the memory limit. If
the job reaches the hard memory limit, LSF kills the job as soon
as it exceeds the memory limit without waiting for the host
memory and swap threshold to be reached.
.sp 2
By default, the limit is specified in KB. Use the
\fBLSF_UNIT_FOR_LIMITS\fR parameter in the lsf.conf file to
specify a larger unit for the limit.
.sp 2
You can use the following units for limits:
.sp 2
*  KB or K (kilobytes)
.sp 2
*  MB or M (megabytes)
.sp 2
*  GB or G (gigabytes)

If the \fBLSB_MEMLIMIT_ENFORCE\fR or \fBLSB_JOB_MEMLIMIT\fR
parameters are set to \fRy\fR in the lsf.conf file, or if you set
the hard memory limits with an exclamation point (\fR!\fR), LSF
kills the job when it exceeds the memory limit or if the host
memory and swap threshold is reached. Otherwise, LSF passes the
memory limit to the operating system. UNIX operating systems that
support \fRRUSAGE_RSS\fR for the setrlimit() function can apply
the memory limit to each process.

.sp 2
A resource requirement string describes the resources a job
needs. LSF uses resource requirements to select hosts for job
execution. Resource requirement strings can be simple (applying
to the entire job), compound (applying to the specified number of
slots), or alternative.
.sp 2
Simple resource requirement strings are divided into the
following sections. Each section has a different syntax.
.sp 2
*  A selection section (select). The selection section specifies
   the criteria for selecting execution hosts from the system.
.sp 2
*  An ordering section (order). The ordering section indicates
   how the hosts that meet the selection criteria should be
   sorted.
.sp 2
*  A resource usage section (rusage). The resource usage section
   specifies the expected resource consumption of the task.
.sp 2
*  A job spanning section (span). The job spanning section
   indicates if a parallel job should span across multiple hosts.
.sp 2
*  A same resource section (same). The same section indicates
   that all processes of a parallel job must run on the same type
   of host.
.sp 2
*  A compute unit resource section (cu). The compute unit section
   specifies topological requirements for spreading a job over
   the cluster.
.sp 2
*  A CPU and memory affinity resource section (affinity). The
   affinity section specifies CPU and memory binding requirements
   for tasks of a job.
.sp 2
The resource requirement string sections have the following
syntax:
.sp 2
select[selection_string] order[order_string] rusage[
.br
usage_string [, usage_string][|| usage_string] ...]
.br
span[span_string] same[same_string] cu[cu_string]] affinity[affinity_string]
.sp 2
The square brackets must be typed as shown for each section. A
blank space must separate each resource requirement section.
.sp 2
For example, to submit a job that runs on Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 6 or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7:
.sp 2
bsub -R "rhel6 || rhel7" myjob
.br

.sp 2
The following command runs the job called \fRmyjob\fR on an HP-UX
host that is lightly loaded (CPU utilization) and has at least 15
MB of swap memory available.
.sp 2
bsub -R "swp > 15 && hpux order[ut]" myjob
.br

.sp 2
You can omit the select keyword (and its square brackets), but if
you include a select section, it must be the first string in the
resource requirement string. If you do not give a section name,
the first resource requirement string is treated as a selection
string (\fRselect[\fIselection_string\fR]\fR).
.sp 2
For example, the following resource requirements are equivalent:
.sp 2
bsub -R "type==any order[ut] same[model] rusage[mem=1]" myjob
.sp 2
bsub -R "select[type==any] order[ut] same[model] rusage[mem=1]" myjob
.sp 2
If you need to include a hyphen (\fR-\fR) or other non-alphabetic
characters within the string, enclose the text in single
quotation marks, for example, bsub -R
"select[hname!=\(aqhost06-x12\(aq]".
.sp 2
The selection string must conform to the strict resource
requirement string syntax described in Administering IBM Spectrum
LSF. The strict resource requirement syntax only applies to the
select section. It does not apply to the other resource
requirement sections (order, rusage, same, span, or cu). LSF
rejects resource requirement strings where an rusage section
contains a non-consumable resource.
.sp 2
If \fBRESRSV_LIMIT\fR is set in lsb.queues, the merged
application-level and job-level rusage consumable resource
requirements must satisfy any limits set by \fBRESRSV_LIMIT\fR,
or the job will be rejected.
.sp 2
Any resource for run queue length, such as r15s, r1m or r15m,
specified in the resource requirements refers to the normalized
run queue length.
.sp 2
By default, memory (\fRmem\fR) and swap (\fRswp\fR) limits in
select[] and rusage[] sections are specified in KB. Use the
\fBLSF_UNIT_FOR_LIMITS\fR parameter in the lsf.conf file to
specify a larger unit for these limits (MB, GB, TB, PB, EB, or
ZB).
.sp 2
You can use the following units for resource requirements and
limits:
.sp 2
*  KB or K (kilobytes)
.sp 2
*  MB or M (megabytes)
.sp 2
*  GB or G (gigabytes)
.sp 2
*  TB or T (terabytes)
.sp 2
*  PB or P (petabytes)
.sp 2
*  EB or E (exabytes)
.sp 2
*  ZB or Z (zettabytes)
.sp 2
The specified unit is converted to the appropriate value
specified by the \fBLSF_UNIT_FOR_LIMITS\fR parameter. The
converted limit values round up to a positive integer. For
resource requirements, you can specify unit for \fRmem\fR,
\fRswp\fR and \fRtmp\fR in select and rusage section.
.sp 2
By default, the \fRtmp\fR resource is not supported by the
\fBLSF_UNIT_FOR_LIMITS\fR parameter. Use the parameter
\fBLSF_ENABLE_TMP_UNIT=Y\fR to enable the
\fBLSF_UNIT_FOR_LIMITS\fR parameter to support limits on the
\fRtmp\fR resource.
.sp 2
If the \fBLSF_ENABLE_TMP_UNIT=Y\fR and
\fBLSF_UNIT_FOR_LIMIT=GB\fR parameters are set, the following
conversion happens.
.sp 2
bsub -C 500MB -M 1G -S 1TB -F 1M -R "rusage[mem=512MB:swp=1GB:tmp=1TB]" sleep 100 
.sp 2
The units in this job submission are converted to the following
units:
.sp 2
 bsub -C 1 -M 1 -S 1024 -F 1024 -R "rusage[mem=0.5:swp=1:tmp=1024]" sleep 100 
.SH Multiple resource requirement strings

.sp 2
The bsub command also accepts multiple -R options for the order,
same, rusage (not multi-phase), and select sections. You can
specify multiple strings instead of using the && operator:
.sp 2
bsub -R "select[swp > 15]" -R "select[hpux] order[r15m]" 
.br
-R rusage[mem=100]" -R "order[ut]" -R "same[type]" 
.br
-R "rusage[tmp=50:duration=60]" -R "same[model]" myjob
.sp 2
LSF merges the multiple -R options into one string and selects a
host that meets all of the resource requirements. The number of
-R option sections is unlimited.
.sp 2
\fBRemember: \fRUse multiple -R options only with the order,
same, rusage (not multi-phase), and select sections of simple
resource requirement strings and with the bsub and bmod commands.
.sp 2
When application-level and queue-level \fRcu\fR sections are also
defined, the job-level \fRcu\fR section takes precedence and
overwrites the application-level requirement definition, which in
turn takes precedence and overwrites the queue-level requirement
definitions.
.sp 2
For example, when \fREXCLUSIVE=CU[enclosure]\fR is specified in
the lsb.queues file, with a compute unit type \fRenclosure\fR in
the lsf.params file, and \fRComputeUnit\fR section in the
lsb.hosts file, the following command submits a job that runs on
64 slots over 4 enclosures or less, and uses the enclosures
exclusively:
.sp 2
bsub -n 64 -R "cu[excl:type=enclosure:maxcus=4]" myjob
.br

.sp 2
A resource called \fRbigmem\fR is defined in the lsf.shared file
as an exclusive resource for host \fRhostE\fR in the lsf.cluster
file. Use the following command to submit a job that runs on
\fRhostE\fR:
.sp 2
bsub -R "bigmem" myjob
.br

.sp 2
or
.sp 2
bsub -R "defined(bigmem)" myjob
.br

.sp 2
A static shared resource is configured for licenses for the
Verilog application as a resource called \fRverilog_lic\fR. To
submit a job that runs on a host when there is a license
available:
.sp 2
bsub -R "select[defined(verilog_lic)] rusage[verilog_lic=1]" myjob
.br

.sp 2
The following job requests 20 MB memory for the duration of the
job, and 1 license for 2 minutes:
.sp 2
bsub -R "rusage[mem=20, license=1:duration=2]" myjob
.br

.sp 2
The following job requests 20 MB of memory, 50 MB of swap space
for 1 hour, and 1 license for 2 minutes:
.sp 2
bsub -R "rusage[mem=20:swp=50:duration=1h, license=1:duration=2]" myjob
.br

.sp 2
The following job requests 20 MB of memory for the duration of
the job, 50 MB of swap space for 1 hour, and 1 license for 2
minutes.
.sp 2
bsub -R "rusage[mem=20,swp=50:duration=1h, license=1:duration=2]" myjob
.br

.sp 2
The following job requests 50 MB of swap space, linearly
decreasing the amount reserved over a duration of 2 hours, and
requests 1 license for 2 minutes:
.sp 2
bsub -R "rusage[swp=50:duration=2h:decay=1, license=1:duration=2]" myjob
.br

.sp 2
The following job requests two resources with same duration but
different decay:
.sp 2
bsub -R "rusage[mem=20:duration=30:decay=1, lic=1:duration=30]" myjob
.br

.sp 2
The following job uses a multi-phase rusage string to request 50
MB of memory for 10 minutes, followed by 10 MB of memory for the
duration of the job:
.sp 2
bsub -R "rusage[mem=(50 10):duration=(10):decay=(0)]" myjob
.br

.sp 2
In the following example, you are running an application version
1.5 as a resource called \fRapp_lic_v15\fR and the same
application version 2.0.1 as a resource called
\fRapp_lic_v201\fR. The license key for version 2.0.1 is backward
compatible with version 1.5, but the license key for version 1.5
does not work with 2.0.1.
.sp 2
\fBNote: \fRJob-level resource requirement specifications that
use the OR (||) operator take precedence over any queue-level
resource requirement specifications.
.sp 2
*  If you can only run your job using one version of the
   application, submit the job without specifying an alternative
   resource. To submit a job that only uses \fRapp_lic_v201\fR:
.sp 2
   bsub -R "rusage[app_lic_v201=1]" myjob
.br

.sp 2
*  If you can run your job using either version of the
   application, try to reserve version 2.0.1 of the application.
   If it is not available, you can use version 1.5. To submit a
   job that tries \fRapp_lic_v201\fR before trying
   \fRapp_lic_v15\fR:
.sp 2
   bsub -R "rusage[app_lic_v201=1||app_lic_v15=1]" myjob
.br

.sp 2
*  If different versions of an application require different
   system resources, you can specify other resources in your
   \fRrusage\fR strings. To submit a job that uses 20 MB of
   memory for \fRapp_lic_v201\fR or 20 MB of memory and 50 MB of
   swap space for \fRapp_lic_v15\fR:
.sp 2
   bsub -R "rusage[mem=20:app_lic_v15=1||mem=20:swp=50:app_lic_v201=1]" myjob
.br

.sp 2
You can specify a threshold at which the consumed resource must
be at before an allocation should be made. For example,
.sp 2
bsub -R "rusage[bwidth=1:threshold=5]" myjob
.br

.sp 2
For example, a job is submitted that consumes 1 unit of bandwidth
(the resource \fRbwidth\fR), but the job should not be scheduled
to run unless the bandwidth on the host is equal to or greater
than 5. In this example, \fRbwidth\fR is a decreasing resource
and the threshold value is interpreted as a floor. If the
resource in question was increasing, then the threshold value
would be interpreted as a ceiling.
.sp 2
An affinity resource requirement string specifies CPU and memory
binding requirements for a resource allocation that is topology
aware. An affinity[] resource requirement section controls the
allocation and distribution of processor units within a host
according to the hardware topology information that LSF collects.
.SH Resource reservation method

.sp 2
Specify the resource reservation method in the resource usage
string by using the \fB/job\fR, \fB/host\fR, or \fB/task\fR
keyword after the numeric value. The resource reservation method
specified in the resource string overrides the global setting
that is specified in the \fBReservationUsage\fR section of the
lsb.resources file. You can only specify resource reservation
methods for consumable resources. Specify the resource
reservation methods as follows:
.sp 2
*  \fR\fIvalue\fR\fB/job\fR\fR
.sp 2
   Specifies per-job reservation of the specified resource. This
   is the equivalent of specifying \fRPER_JOB\fR for the
   \fBMETHOD\fR parameter in the \fBReservationUsage\fR section
   of the lsb.resources file.
.sp 2
*  \fR\fIvalue\fR\fB/host\fR\fR
.sp 2
   Specifies per-host reservation of the specified resource. This
   is the equivalent of specifying \fRPER_HOST\fR for the
   \fBMETHOD\fR parameter in the \fBReservationUsage\fR section
   of the lsb.resources file.
.sp 2
*  \fR\fIvalue\fR\fB/task\fR\fR
.sp 2
   Specifies per-task reservation of the specified resource. This
   is the equivalent of specifying \fRPER_TASK\fR for the
   \fBMETHOD\fR parameter in the \fBReservationUsage\fR section
   of the lsb.resources file.
.sp 2
*  Basic syntax:
.sp 2
   resource_name=value/method:duration=value:decay=value
.sp 2
   For example,
.sp 2
   rusage[mem=10/host:duration=10:decay=0]
.sp 2
*  Multi-phase memory syntax:
.sp 2
   resource_name=(value ...)/method:duration=(value ...):decay=value
.sp 2
   For example,
.sp 2
   rusage[mem=(50 20)/task:duration=(10 5):decay=0]
.SH Compound resource requirements

.sp 2
In some cases different resource requirements may apply to
different parts of a parallel job. The first execution host, for
example, may require more memory or a faster processor for
optimal job scheduling. Compound resource requirements allow you
to specify different requirements for some slots within a job in
the queue-level, application-level, or job-level resource
requirement string.
.sp 2
Compound resource requirement strings can be set by the
application-level or queue-level \fBRES_REQ\fR parameter, or used
with the bsub -R option when a job is submitted. The bmod -R
option accepts compound resource requirement strings for pending
jobs but not running jobs.
.sp 2
Special rules take effect when compound resource requirements are
merged with resource requirements defined at more than one level.
If a compound resource requirement is used at any level (job,
application, or queue) the compound multi-level resource
requirement combinations apply.
.sp 2
Compound resource requirement strings are made up of one or more
simple resource requirement strings as follows:
.sp 2
num1*{simple_string1} + num2*{simple_string2} + ...
.br

.sp 2
where \fInumx\fR is the number of slots affected and
\fIsimple_stringx\fR is a simple resource requirement string.
.sp 2
The same resource requirement can be used within each component
expression (simple resource requirement). For example, for static
string resource \fRres1\fR and \fRres2\fR, a resource requirement
such as the following is permitted:
.sp 2
"4*{select[io] same[res1]} + 4*{select[compute] same[res1]}"
.sp 2
With this resource requirement, there are two simple
subexpressions, \fRR1\fR and \fRR2\fR. For each of these
subexpressions, all slots must come from hosts with equal values
of res1. However, \fRR1\fR may occupy hosts of a different value
than those occupied by \fRR2\fR.
.sp 2
You can specify a global same requirement that takes effect over
multiple subexpressions of a compound resource requirement
string. For example,
.sp 2
"{4*{select[io]} + 4*{select[compute]}} same[res1]"
.sp 2
This syntax allows users to express that both subexpressions must
reside on hosts that have a common value for \fRres1\fR.
.sp 2
In general, there may be more than two subexpressions in a
compound resource requirement. The global same will apply to all
of them.
.sp 2
Arbitrary nesting of brackets is not permitted. For example, you
cannot have a global same apply to only two of three
subexpressions of a compound resource requirement. However, each
subexpression can have its own local same as well as a global
same for the compound expression as a whole. For example, the
following is permitted:
.sp 2
"{4*{same[res1]} + 4*{same[res1]}} same[res2]"
.sp 2
In addition, a compound resource requirement expression with a
global same may be part of a larger alternative resource
requirement string.
.sp 2
A compound resource requirement expression with a global same can
be used in the following instances:
.sp 2
*  Submitting a job: bsub -R "res_req_string"
   <other_bsub_options> a.out
.sp 2
*  Configuring application profile (lsb.applications file):
   RES_REQ = "res_req_string"
.sp 2
*  Queue configuration (lsb.queues file): RES_REQ =
   "res_req_string"
.sp 2
\fBSyntax:\fR
.sp 2
*  A single compound resource requirement:
.sp 2
   \fR"{\fIcompound_res_req\fR} same[\fIsame_string\fR]"\fR
.sp 2
*  A compound resource requirement within an alternative resource
   requirement:
.sp 2
   \fR"{{\fIcompound_res_req\fR} same[\fIsame_string\fR]} ||
   {\fIalt_res_req\fR}"\fR
.sp 2
*  A compound resource requirement within an alternative resource
   requirement with delay:
.sp 2
   \fR"{\fIalt_res_req\fR} || {{\fIcompound_res_req\fR}
   same[\fIsame_string\fR]}@\fIdelay\fR"\fR
.sp 2
   The \fIdelay\fR option is a positive integer.
.sp 2
\fBRestriction: \fR
.sp 2
*  Compound resource requirements cannot contain the || operator.
   Compound resource requirements cannot be defined (included) in
   any multiple -R options.
.sp 2
*  Compound resource requirements cannot contain the compute unit
   (cu) keywords balance or excl, but works normally with other
   cu keywords (including pref, type, maxcus, and usablecuslots).
.sp 2
*  Resizable jobs can have compound resource requirements, but
   only the portion of the job represented by the last term of
   the compound resource requirement is eligible for automatic
   resizing. When you use the bresize release to release slots,
   you can release only slots represented by the last term of the
   compound resource requirement. To release slots in earlier
   terms, run the bresize release command repeatedly to release
   slots in subsequent last terms.
.sp 2
*  Compound resource requirements cannot be specified in the
   definition of a guaranteed resource pool.
.sp 2
*  Resource allocation for parallel jobs using compound resources
   is done for each compound resource term in the order listed
   instead of considering all possible combinations. A host
   rejected for not satisfying one resource requirement term will
   not be reconsidered for subsequent resource requirement terms.
.sp 2
For jobs without the number of total slots specified with the
bsub -n command, the final \fInumx\fR can be omitted. The final
resource requirement is then applied to the zero or more slots
not yet accounted for:
.sp 2
*  \fR(\fIfinal res_req number of slots\fR) = (\fItotal number of
   job slots\fR)-(\fInum1\fR+\fInum2\fR+ ...)\fR
.sp 2
For jobs with the total number of slots specified with the
\fRbsub -n \fInum_slots\fR\fR command, the total number of slots
must match the number of slots in the resource requirement:
.sp 2
*  \fR\fInum_slots\fR=(\fInum1\fR+\fInum2\fR+\fInum3\fR+ ...)\fR
.sp 2
For jobs with the minimum and maximum number of slots specified
with the \fRbsub -n \fImin\fR, \fImax\fR\fR command, the number
of slots in the compound resource requirement must be compatible
with the minimum and maximum specified.
.sp 2
You can specify the number of slots or processors through the
resource requirement specification. For example, you can specify
a job that requests 10 slots or processors: 1 on a host that has
more than 5000 MB of memory, and an additional 9 on hosts that
have more than 1000 MB of memory:
.sp 2
\fRbsub -R "1*{mem>5000} + 9*{mem>1000}" a.out\fR
.sp 2
To specify compound GPU resource requirements, use the following
keywords and options:
.sp 2
*  In the rusage[] section, use the ngpus_physical resource to
   request the number of physical GPUs, together with the gmodel
   option specify the GPU model, the gmem option to specify the
   amount of reserved GPU memory, the glink option to request
   only GPUs with special connections (xGMI connections for AMD
   GPUs or NVLink connections for Nvidia GPUs), and the mig
   option to specify Nvidia Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) device
   requirements.
.sp 2
*  In the span[] section, use the gtile keyword to specify the
   number of GPUs requested on each socket.
.sp 2
\fBNote: \fRIf you specify GPU resource requirements with the
bsub -R command option, or the \fBRES_REQ\fR parameter, the LSF
ignores the -gpu option, as well as the \fBLSB_GPU_REQ\fR and
\fBGPU_REQ\fR parameters.
.sp 2
The following example requests 2 hosts, reserving 2 GPUs, spread
evenly across each socket for the first host, and 4 other hosts
with 1 GPU on each host with 10 GB memory reserved for each GPU:
.sp 2
bsub -R "1*{span[gtile=!] rusage[ngpus_physical=2:gmem=1G]} + 4*{span[ptile=1] rusage[ngpus_physical=1:gmem=10G]}" ./app
.SH Alternative resource requirements

.sp 2
In some circumstances more than one set of resource requirements
may be acceptable for a job to be able to run. LSF provides the
ability to specify alternative resource requirements.
.sp 2
An alternative resource requirement consists of two or more
individual simple or compound resource requirements. Each
separate resource requirement describes an alternative. When a
job is submitted with alternative resource requirements, the
alternative resource picked must satisfy the mandatory first
execution host. If none of the alternatives can satisfy the
mandatory first execution host, the job will PEND.
.sp 2
Alternative resource requirement strings can be specified at the
application-level or queue-level \fBRES_REQ\fR parameter, or used
with bsub -R when a job is submitted. bmod -R also accepts
alternative resource requirement strings for pending jobs.
.sp 2
The rules for merging job, application, and queue alternative
resource requirements are the same as for compound resource
requirements.
.sp 2
Alternative resource requirements cannot be used with the
following features:
.sp 2
*  Multiple bsub -R commands
.sp 2
*  Taskstarter jobs, including those with the tssub command
.sp 2
*  Hosts from HPC integrations that use toplib, including cpuset
   and Blue Gene hosts.
.sp 2
*  Compute unit (\fRcu\fR) sections specified with \fRbalance\fR
   or \fRexcl\fR keywords.
.sp 2
If a job with alternative resource requirements specified is
re-queued, it will have all alternative resource requirements
considered during scheduling. If a \fR@D\fR delay time is
specified, it is interpreted as waiting, starting from the
original submission time. For a restart job, \fR@D\fR delay time
starts from the restart job submission time.
.sp 2
An alternative resource requirement consists of two or more
individual resource requirements. Each separate resource
requirement describes an alternative. If the resources cannot be
found that satisfy the first resource requirement, then the next
resource requirement is tried, and so on until the requirement is
satisfied.
.sp 2
Alternative resource requirements are defined in terms of a
compound resource requirement, or an atomic resource requirement:
.sp 2
bsub -R "{C1 | R1 } || {C2 | R2 }@D2 || ... || {Cn | Rn }@Dn" 
.br

.sp 2
Where
.sp 2
*  The OR operator (||) separates one alternative resource from
   the next.
.sp 2
*  The \fIC\fR option is a compound resource requirement.
.sp 2
*  The \fIR\fR option is a resource requirement which is the same
   as the current LSF resource requirement, except when there is:
.sp 2
   *  No rusage OR (||).
.sp 2
   *  No compute unit requirement cu[...]
.sp 2
*  The \fID\fR option is a positive integer:
.sp 2
   *  \fR@\fID\fR\fR is optional: Do not evaluate the alternative
      resource requirement until \fID\fR minutes after submission
      time, and requeued jobs still use submission time instead
      of requeue time. There is no \fRD1\fR because the first
      alternative is always evaluated immediately.
.sp 2
   *  \fRD2\fR <= \fRD3\fR <= ... <= \fRD\fIn\fR\fR
.sp 2
   *  Not specifying \fR@\fID\fR\fR means that the alternative
      will be evaluated without delay if the previous alternative
      could not be used to obtain a job\(aqs allocation.
.sp 2
For example, you may have a sequential job, but you want
alternative resource requirements (that is, if LSF fails to match
your resource, try another one).
.sp 2
bsub -R "{ select[type==any] order[ut] same[model] rusage[mem=1] } ||  
.br
{ select[type==any] order[ls] same[ostype] rusage[mem=5] }" myjob
.sp 2
You can also add a delay before trying the second alternative:
.sp 2
bsub -R "{ select[type==any] order[ut] same[model] rusage[mem=1] } || 
.br
{ select[type==any] order[ls] same[ostype] rusage[mem=5] }@4" myjob
.sp 2
You can also have more than 2 alternatives:
.sp 2
bsub -R "{select[type==any] order[ut] same[model] rusage[mem=1] } || 
.br
{ select[type==any] order[ut] same[model] rusage[mem=1] } || 
.br
{ select[type==any] order[ut] same[model] rusage[mem=1] }@3 || 
.br
{ select[type==any] order[ut] same[model] rusage[mem=1] }@6" myjob
.sp 2
Some parallel jobs might need compound resource requirements. You
can specify alternatives for parallel jobs the same way. That is,
you can have several alternative sections each with brace
brackets (\fR{ }\fR) around them separated by ||):
.sp 2
bsub -n 2 -R "{ 1*{ select[type==any] order[ut] same[model] rusage[mem=1]} + 1
.br
*{ select[type==any] order[ut] same[model] rusage[mem=1] } } ||
.br
{  1*{ select[type==any] order[ut] same[model] rusage[mem=1]} + 
.br
1*{ select[type==any] order[ut] same[model]
.br
rusage[mem=1] } }@6" myjob
.br

.sp 2
Alternatively, the compound resource requirement section can have
both slots requiring the same resource:
.sp 2
bsub -n 2 -R "{ 1*{ select[type==any] order[ut] same[model] rusage[mem=1]} 
.br
+1*{ select[type==any] order[ut] same[model] rusage[mem=1] } } || 
.br
{  2*{ select[type==any] order[ut] same[model] rusage[mem=1] } }@10" myjob 
.sp 2
An alternative resource requirement can be used to indicate how
many tasks the job requires. For example, a job may request 4
tasks on Solaris host types, or 8 tasks on Linux86 hosts types.
If the -n option is provided at the job level, then the values
specified must be consistent with the values implied by the
resource requirement string:
.sp 2
bsub -R " {8*{type==LINUX86}} || {4*{type==SOLARIS}}" a.out
.sp 2
If they conflict, the job submission is rejected:
.sp 2
bsub -n 3 -R " {8*{type==LINUX86}} || {4*{type==SOLARIS}}" a.out
.sp 2
To specify alternative GPU resource requirements, use the
following keywords and options:
.sp 2
*  In the rusage[] section, use the ngpus_physical resource to
   request the number of physical GPUs, together with the gmodel
   option specify the GPU model, the gmem option to specify the
   amount of reserved GPU memory, the glink option to request
   only GPUs with special connections (xGMI connections for AMD
   GPUs or NVLink connections for Nvidia GPUs), and the mig
   option to specify Nvidia Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) device
   requirements.
.sp 2
*  In the span[] section, use the gtile keyword to specify the
   number of GPUs requested on each socket.
.sp 2
The following example requests 4 hosts with 1 K80 GPU on each
host, or 1 host with 2 P100 GPUs and 1 GPU per socket:
.sp 2
bsub -R "{4*{span[ptile=1] rusage[ngpus_physical=1:gmodel=K80]}} || {1*{span[gtile=1] rusage[ngpus_physical=2:gmodel=P100]}}" ./app

.sp 2
\fBbsub -U \fRreservation_ID
.SH Description

.sp 2
For example, if the following command was used to create the
reservation user1#0:
.sp 2
brsvadd -n 1024 -m hostA -u user1 -b 13:0 -e 18:0
.br
Reservation "user1#0" is created
.br

.sp 2
The following command uses the reservation:
.sp 2
bsub -U user1#0 myjob
.br

.sp 2
The job can only use hosts reserved by the reservation
\fRuser1#0\fR. LSF only selects hosts in the reservation. You can
use the -m option to specify particular hosts within the list of
hosts reserved by the reservation, but you cannot specify other
hosts not included in the original reservation.
.sp 2
If you do not specify hosts (bsub -m) or resource requirements
(bsub -R), the default resource requirement is to select hosts
that are of any host type (LSF assumes "type==any" instead of
"type==local" as the default select string).
.sp 2
If you later delete the advance reservation while it is still
active, any pending jobs still keep the "type==any" attribute.
.sp 2
A job can only use one reservation. There is no restriction on
the number of jobs that can be submitted to a reservation;
however, the number of slots available on the hosts in the
reservation may run out. For example, reservation \fRuser2#0\fR
reserves 128 slots on \fRhostA\fR. When all 128 slots on
\fRhostA\fR are used by jobs referencing \fRuser2#0\fR,
\fRhostA\fR is no longer available to other jobs using
reservation \fRuser2#0\fR. Any single user or user group can have
a maximum of 100 reservation IDs.
.sp 2
Jobs referencing the reservation are killed when the reservation
expires. LSF administrators can prevent running jobs from being
killed when the reservation expires by changing the termination
time of the job using the reservation (bmod -t) before the
reservation window closes.
.sp 2
To use an advance reservation on a remote host, submit the job
and specify the remote advance reservation ID. For example:
.sp 2
bsub -U user1#01@cluster1
.br

.sp 2
In this example, it is assumed that the default queue is
configured to forward jobs to the remote cluster.

\fBbsub -W\fR [hour\fB:\fR]minute[\fB/\fRhost_name |

.SH Description

.sp 2
If a UNIX job runs longer than the specified run limit, the job
is sent a SIGUSR2 signal, and is killed if it does not terminate
within ten minutes. If a Windows job runs longer than the
specified run limit, it is killed immediately. (For a detailed
description of how these jobs are killed, see bkill.)
.sp 2
In the queue definition, a \fBTERMINATE\fR action can be
configured to override the bkill default action (see the
\fBJOB_CONTROLS\fR parameter in lsb.queues).
.sp 2
In an application profile definition, a \fBTERMINATE_CONTROL\fR
action can be configured to override the bkill default action
(see the \fBTERMINATE_CONTROL\fR parameter in lsb.applications).
.sp 2
If you want to provide LSF with an estimated run time without
killing jobs that exceed this value, submit the job with -We, or
define the \fBRUNTIME\fR parameter in lsb.applications and submit
the job to that application profile. LSF uses the estimated
runtime value for scheduling purposes only.
.sp 2
The run limit is in the form of [\fIhour\fR\fR:\fR]\fIminute\fR.
The minutes can be specified as a number greater than 59. For
example, three and a half hours can either be specified as 3:30,
or 210.
.sp 2
The run limit you specify is the normalized run time. This is
done so that the job does approximately the same amount of
processing, even if it is sent to host with a faster or slower
CPU. Whenever a normalized run time is given, the actual time on
the execution host is the specified time multiplied by the CPU
factor of the normalization host then divided by the CPU factor
of the execution host.
.sp 2
If \fBABS_RUNLIMIT=Y\fR is defined in lsb.params, the runtime
limit and the runtime estimate are not normalized by the host CPU
factor. Absolute wall-clock run time is used for all jobs
submitted with a runtime limit or runtime estimate.
.sp 2
Optionally, you can supply a host name or a host model name
defined in LSF. You must insert ‘\fR/\fR\(aq between the run limit
and the host name or model name.
.sp 2
If no host or host model is given, LSF uses the default runtime
normalization host defined at the queue level
(\fBDEFAULT_HOST_SPEC\fR in lsb.queues) if it has been
configured; otherwise, LSF uses the default CPU time
normalization host defined at the cluster level
(\fBDEFAULT_HOST_SPEC\fR in lsb.params) if it has been
configured; otherwise, LSF uses the submission host.
.sp 2
For LSF multicluster capability jobs, if no other CPU time
normalization host is defined and information about the
submission host is not available, LSF uses the host with the
largest CPU factor (the fastest host in the cluster).
.sp 2
If the job also has termination time specified through the bsub
-t option, LSF determines whether the job can actually run for
the specified length of time allowed by the run limit before the
termination time. If not, then the job is aborted.
.sp 2
If the \fBIGNORE_DEADLINE\fR parameter is set in lsb.queues, this
behavior is overridden and the run limit is ignored.
.sp 2
Jobs submitted to a chunk job queue are not chunked if the run
limit is greater than 30 minutes.

\fBbsub -a "\fRapplication_name
[([argument[,argument...]])]...\fB"\fR
.SH Description

.sp 2
The value of -a must correspond to the application name of an
actual esub or epsub file. For example, to use bsub -a fluent,
one or both of the esub.fluent or epsub.fluent files must exist
in \fBLSF_SERVERDIR\fR.
.sp 2
For example, to submit a job that invokes the
application-specific esub (or epsub) executables named
esub.license (or epsub.license) and esub.fluent (or
epsub.fluent), enter:
.sp 2
bsub -a "license fluent" my_job
.sp 2
The name of the application-specific esub or epsub program is
passed to the parent esub. The parent esub program
(LSF_SERVERDIR/mesub) handles job submission requirements of the
application. Application-specific esub programs can specify their
own job submission requirements. The value of -a is set in the
\fBLSB_SUB_ADDITIONAL\fR environment variable.
.sp 2
mesub uses the method name license to invoke the esub named
LSF_SERVERDIR/esub.license or the epsub named
LSF_SERVERDIR/epsub.license, and the method name fluent to invoke
the esub named LSF_SERVERDIR/esub.fluent or the epsub named
LSF_SERVERDIR/epsub.fluent. Therefore, mesub is run twice: Before
the job is submitted to mbatchd to run the esub scripts, and
after the job is submitted to run the epsub scripts.
.sp 2
LSF first invokes the executable file named esub (without
\fI.application_name\fR in the file name) if it exists in
\fBLSF_SERVERDIR\fR, followed by any mandatory esub or epsub
executable files that are defined using the parameter
\fBLSB_ESUB_METHOD\fR in the lsf.conf file, and then any
application-specific esub executable files (with
\fI.application_name\fR in the file name) specified by -a. After
the job is submitted, LSF invokes the executable file named epsub
(without \fI.application_name\fR in the file name) if it exists
in \fBLSF_SERVERDIR\fR, followed by any mandatory epsub
executable files (as specified using the parameter
\fBLSB_ESUB_METHOD\fR), and then any application-specific epsub
executable files (with \fI.application_name\fR in the file name)
specified by -a.
.sp 2
The name of the esub or epsub program must be a valid file name.
It can contain only alphanumeric characters, underscore (\fR_\fR)
and hyphen (\fR-\fR).
.sp 2
\fBRestriction: \fRIf the value of -a corresponds to a value in
\fBLSB_ESUB_METHOD\fR, this value must correspond to an actual
esub or epsub file in \fBLSF_SERVERDIR\fR. For example, if
\fRfluent\fR is defined in \fBLSB_ESUB_METHOD\fR, the esub.fluent
or epsub.fluent file must exist in \fBLSF_SERVERDIR\fR to use
bsub -a fluent.
.sp 2
If you have an esub or epsub that runs an interactive or X-window
job and you have SSH enabled in lsf.conf, the communication
between hosts is encrypted.
.sp 2
esub arguments provide flexibility for filtering and modifying
job submissions by letting you specify options for esub
executable files. epsub provides the flexibility to perform
external logic using information about jobs that are just
submitted, such as the assigned job ID and queue name.
.sp 2
The variables you define in the esub and epsub arguments can
include environment variables and command output substitution.
.sp 2
\fBNote: \fRThe same arguments that are passed to esub are also
passed to epsub. You cannot pass different arguments to an esub
file and an epsub file with the same application name.
.sp 2
Valid esub and epsub arguments can contain alphanumeric
characters, spaces, special characters (\fR`"\$!\fR) and other
characters (\fR~@#%^&*()-=_+[]|{};\(aq:,./<>?\fR). Special patterns
like variables (for example, \fR$PATH\fR) and program output (for
example, `ls` command output) in an esub or epsub argument will
also be processed.
.sp 2
For example, if you use bsub -a “esub1 ($PATH, `ls`)” user_job,
the first argument passed to esub1 would be the value of variable
\fIPATH\fR, and the second argument passed to esub1 would be the
output of command ls.
.sp 2
You can include a special character in an esub or epsub argument
with an escape character or a pair of apostrophes (\(aq\(aq). The usage
may vary among different shells. You can specify an argument
containing separators (\(aq\fR(\fR\(aq, \(aq\fR)\fR\(aq, \(aq\fR,\fR\(aq) and space
characters (\(aq\fR\fR\(aq).
.sp 2
You can also use an escape character (\fR\\fR) to specify
arguments containing special characters, separators and space
characters. For example:
.sp 2
bsub –a “application_name1(var1,var2 contain \(\)\,)” user_job
.sp 2
For fault tolerance, extra space characters are allowed between
entities including esub/epsub, separators, and arguments. For
example, the following is valid input:
.sp 2
bsub -a “ esub1 ( var1 , var2 ) ” user_job
.sp 2
The maximum length allowed for an esub/epsub argument is 1024
characters. The maximum number of arguments allowed for an
esub/epsub is 128.
.sp 2
Jobs submitted with an esub (or epsub) will show all the esubs in
bjobs -l output, first with the default and then user esubs.
.SH Examples

.sp 2
*  To specify a single argument for a single esub/epsub
   executable file, use:

.SH Synopsis

\fBbsub -c\fR [hour\fB:\fR]minute[\fB/\fRhost_name |
\fB/\fRhost_model]
.SH Description

.sp 2
This option is useful for preventing runaway jobs or jobs that
use up too many resources. When the total CPU time for the whole
job has reached the limit, a SIGXCPU signal is first sent to the
job, then SIGINT, SIGTERM, and SIGKILL.
.sp 2
If \fBLSB_JOB_CPULIMIT\fR in lsf.conf is set to n, LSF-enforced
CPU limit is disabled and LSF passes the limit to the operating
system. When one process in the job exceeds the CPU limit, the
limit is enforced by the operating system.
.sp 2
The CPU limit is in the form of [\fIhour\fR\fR:\fR]\fIminute\fR.
The minutes can be specified as a number greater than 59. For
example, three and a half hours can either be specified as 3:30,
or 210.
.sp 2
The CPU time you specify is the \fInormalized\fR CPU time. This
is done so that the job does approximately the same amount of
processing for a given CPU limit, even if it is sent to host with
a faster or slower CPU. Whenever a normalized CPU time is given,
the actual time on the execution host is the specified time
multiplied by the CPU factor of the normalization host then
divided by the CPU factor of the execution host.
.sp 2
Optionally, you can supply a host name or a host model name
defined in LSF. You must insert a slash (\fR/\fR) between the CPU
limit and the host name or model name. If a host name or model
name is not given, LSF uses the default CPU time normalization
host defined at the queue level (\fBDEFAULT_HOST_SPEC\fR in
lsb.queues) if it has been configured, otherwise uses the default
CPU time normalization host defined at the cluster level
(\fBDEFAULT_HOST_SPEC\fR in lsb.params) if it has been
configured, otherwise uses the submission host.
.sp 2
Jobs submitted to a chunk job queue are not chunked if the CPU
limit is greater than 30 minutes.
.SH Examples

.sp 2
\fRbsub -q "queue1 queue2 queue3" -c 5 my_program\fR
.sp 2

.SH Description

.sp 2
You can specify cluster names when submitting jobs for LSF
multicluster capability.
.sp 2
The -clusters option has the following keywords:
.sp 2
\fBall\fR
.br
         Specifies both local cluster and all remote clusters in
         the \fBSNDJOBS_TO\fR parameter of the target queue in
         \fBlsb.queues\fR. For example:
.sp 2
         \fRbsub -clusters all -q <\fIsend_queue\fR>\fR
.sp 2
         LSF will go through the\fB SNDJOBS_TO\fR parameter in
         lsb.queues to check whether asked clusters (except for
         the local cluster) are members of \fBSNDJOBS_TO\fR. If
         any cluster except the local cluster does not exist in
         \fBSNDJOBS_TO\fR, the job is rejected with an error
         message.
.sp 2
\fBothers\fR
.br
         Sends the job to all clusters except for the clusters
         you specify. For example:
.sp 2
         \fRbsub -clusters "c1+3 c2+1 others+2"\fR
.sp 2
\fB~\fR
.br
         Must be used with all to indicate the rest of the
         clusters, excluding the specified clusters.
.sp 2
\fB+\fR
.br
         When followed by a positive integer, specifies job level
         preference for requested clusters. For example:
.sp 2
         \fRbsub -clusters "c1+2 c2+1"\fR
.sp 2
If the local cluster name is local_c1, and
\fBSNDJOBS_TO\fR\fR=q1@rmt_c1 q2@rmt_c2 q3@rmt_c3\fR, then the
requested cluster should be \fRlocal_c1\fR and \fRrmt_c3\fR. For
example:
.sp 2
\fRbsub -clusters "all ~rmt_c1 ~rmt_c2"\fR
.sp 2
-clusters local_cluster restricts the job for dispatch to local
hosts. To run a job on remote clusters only, use:
.sp 2
\fRbsub -clusters "all ~local_cluster"\fR
.sp 2
A job that only specifies remote clusters will not run on local
hosts. Similarly, a job that only specifies local clusters will
not run on remote hosts. If a job specifies local and remote
clusters, the job tries local hosts first, then remote clusters.
.sp 2
If there are multiple default queues, then when \fRbsub -clusters
remote_clusters\fR is issued, the job is sent to the queue whose
\fBSNDJOBS_TO\fR contains the requested clusters. For example:
.sp 2
\fRbsub -clusters "c2" , DEFAULT_QUEUE=q1 q2, q1:
SNDJOBS_TO=recvQ1@c1 recvQ2@c3, q2: SNDJOBS_TO=recvQ1@c1
recvQ2@c2\fR
.sp 2
The job is sent to \fRq2\fR.
.sp 2
To have the job try to run on only local hosts:
.sp 2
\fRbsub -q mc -clusters local_c1\fR
.sp 2
To have the job try to run on only remote hosts (e.g.,
\fRrmt_c1\fR and \fRrmt_c2\fR):
.sp 2
\fRbsub -q mc -clusters rmt_c1 rmt_c2\fR
.sp 2
To have the job first try local hosts, then \fRrmt_c1\fR and
\fRrmt_c2\fR:
.sp 2
\fRbsub -q mc -clusters local_c1 rmt_c1 rmt_c2\fR
.sp 2
To ignore preference for the local cluster (because the local
cluster is always tried first, even though remote clusters have
higher job level preference) and try remote clusters:
.sp 2
\fRbsub -q mc -clusters local_c1 rmt_c1+2 rmt_c2+1\fR
.sp 2
To have the job first try the local cluster, then remote
clusters:
.sp 2
\fRbsub -q mc -clusters all\fR
.sp 2
To have the job first try the local cluster, then try all remote
clusters except for \fRrmt_c1\fR:
.sp 2
\fRbsub -q mc -clusters all ~rmt_c1\fR
.sp 2
To have the job try only remote clusters:
.sp 2
\fRbsub -q mc -clusters all ~local_c1\fR
.sp 2
The -clusters option is supported in esub, so LSF administrators
can direct jobs to specific clusters if they want to implement
flow control. The -m option and -clusters option cannot be used
together.

.sp 2
The system creates the current working directory (CWD) if the
path for the CWD includes dynamic patterns for both absolute and
relative paths. LSF cleans the created CWD based on the time to
live value set in the \fBJOB_CWD_TTL\fR parameter of the
application profile or in lsb.params.
.sp 2
The path can include the following dynamic patterns, which are
case sensitive:
.sp 2
*  %J - job ID
.sp 2
*  %JG - job group (if not specified, it will be ignored)
.sp 2
*  %I - index (default value is 0)
.sp 2
*  %EJ - execution job ID
.sp 2
*  %EI - execution index
.sp 2
*  %P - project name
.sp 2
*  %U - user name
.sp 2
*  %G - user group
.sp 2
*  %H - first execution host name
.sp 2
If the job is submitted with -app but without -cwd, and
\fBLSB_JOB_CWD\fR is not defined, then the application profile
defined \fBJOB_CWD\fR will be used. If \fBJOB_CWD\fR is not
defined in the application profile, then the
\fBDEFAULT_JOB_CWD\fR value is used.
.sp 2
In forwarding mode, if a job is not submitted with the -cwd
option and \fBLSB_JOB_CWD\fR is not defined, then \fBJOB_CWD\fR
in the application profile or the \fBDEFAULT_JOB_CWD\fR value for
the execution cluster is used.
.sp 2
LSF does not allow environment variables to contain other
environment variables to be expanded on the execution side.
.sp 2
By default, if the current working directory is not accessible on
the execution host, the job runs in /tmp (on UNIX) or
c:\LSF\fIversion_num\fR\tmp (on Windows). If the environment
variable \fBLSB_EXIT_IF_CWD_NOTEXIST\fR is set to Y and the
current working directory is not accessible on the execution
host, the job exits with the exit code 2.
.SH Examples

.SH Description

.sp 2
You can specify data requirements for the job three ways:
.sp 2
*  As a list of files for staging.
.sp 2
*  An absolute path to a folder that contains files for staging.
.sp 2
*  As a list of arbitrary tag names.
.sp 2
Your job can specify multiple -data options, but all the
requested data requirements must be either tags, files, or
folders. You can specify individual files, folders, or data
specification files in each -data clause. You cannot mix tag
names with file specifications in the same submission. The
combined requirement of all -data clauses, including the
requirements that are specified inside specification files, are
combined into a single space-separated string of file
requirements.
.sp 2
Valid file or tag names can contain only alphanumeric characters
(\fR[A-z|a-z|0-9]\fR), and a period (\fR.\fR), underscore
(\fR_\fR), and dash (\fR-\fR). The tag or file name cannot
contain the special operating system names for parent directory
(\fR../\fR), current directory (\fR./\fR), or user home directory
(\fR~/\fR). File, folder, and tag names cannot contain spaces.
Tag names cannot begin with a dash character.
.sp 2
A list of files must contain absolute paths to the required
source files. The list of files can refer to actual data files
your job requires or to a data specification file that contains a
list of the data files. The first line of a data specification
file must be \fR#@dataspec\fR.
.sp 2
A data requirement that is a folder must contain an absolute path
to the folder. The colon character (\fR:\fR) is supported in the
path of a job requirement.
.sp 2
A host name is optional. The default host name is the submission
host. The host name is the host that LSF attempts to stage the
required data file from. You cannot substitute IP addresses for
host names.
.sp 2
By default, if the \fBCACHE_PERMISSIONS=group\fR parameter is
specified in lsf.datamanager, the data manager uses the primary
group of the user who submitted the job to control access to the
cached files. Only users that belong to that group can access the
files in the data requirement. Use the -datagrp option to specify
a particular user group for access to the cache. The user who
submits the job must be a member of the specified group. You can
specify only one -datagrp option per job.
.sp 2
The \fItag_name\fR element is any string that can be used as a
valid data tag.
.sp 2
If the \fBCACHE_ACCESS_CONTROL = Y\fR parameter is configured in
the lsf.datamanager file, you can optionally specify a user name
for the tag owner \fRtag:[\fItag_owner\fR@]\fItag_name\fR\fR.
.sp 2
The sanity check for the existence of files or folders and
whether the user can access them, discovery of the size and
modification of the files or folders, and generation of the hash
from the bsub command occurs in the transfer job. This equalizes
submission performance between jobs with and without data
requirements. The -datachk option forces the bsub and bmod
commands to perform these operations. If the data requirement is
for a tag, the -datachk option has no effect.
.sp 2
You can use the \fR%I\fR runtime variable in file paths. The
variable resolves to an array index in a job array submission. If
the job is not an array, \fR%I\fR in the data specification is
interpreted as \fR0\fR. You cannot use the \fR%I\fR variable in
tag names.
.sp 2
The path to the data requirement files or the files that are
listed inside data specification files can contain wildcard
characters. All paths that are resolved from wildcard characters
are interpreted as files to transfer. The path to a data
specification file cannot contain wildcard characters.
.sp 2
The use of wildcard characters has the following rules:
.sp 2
*  A path that ends in a slash followed by an asterisk (\fR/*\fR)
   is interpreted as a directory. For example, a path like
   \fR/data/august/*\fR. Transfers only the files in the august
   directory without recursion into subdirectories.
.sp 2
*  A path that ends in a slash (\fR/\fR) means that you want to
   transfer all of the files in the folder and all files in all
   of its sub folders, recursively.
.sp 2
*  You can use the asterisk (\fR*\fR) wildcard character only at
   the end of the path. For example, a path like
   \fR/data/*/file_*.*\fR is not supported. The following path is
   correct: \fR/data/august/*\fR. The \fR*\fR is subject to
   expansion by the shell and must be quoted properly.
.sp 2
*  When wildcard characters are expanded, symbolic links in a
   path are expanded. If a broken symbolic link is detected, the
   job submission fails.
.sp 2
*  When you use the asterisk character at the end of the path,
   the data file requirements must be in quotation marks.

.SH Description

.sp 2
For jobs with a data requirement, this command option forces the
bsub and bmod commands to perform the following operations on the
files or folders:
.sp 2
*  Sanity check to see if the files or folders exist
.sp 2
*  Check whether the submission user can access the files or
   folders
.sp 2
*  Discover the size and modification times of the files or
   folders
.sp 2
*  Generate a hash for each file or folder
.sp 2
If you do not specify this command option, these operations occur
at the transfer job by default. You can also force the bsub and
bmod commands to perform these operations by setting the
LSF_DATA_BSUB_CHKSUM parameter to \fRy\fR or \fRY\fR in the
lsf.conf file.

[\fB-datagrp\fR \fB"\fRuser_group_name \fB"\fR]
.SH Description

.sp 2
By default, if the \fBCACHE_PERMISSIONS=group\fR parameter is
specified in lsf.datamanager, the data manager uses the primary
group of the user who submitted the job to control access to the
cached files. Only users who belong to that group can access the
files in the data requirement. Use the -datagrp option to specify
a particular user group for access to the cache. The user who
submits the job must be a member of the specified group. You can
specify only one -datagrp option per job.
.sp 2
The job must have a data requirement to use -datagrp.
.sp 2
Normally, if you submit a data job with the -datagrp option, you
must belong to the data group specified. If you do not belong to
the specified group, the mbatchd daemon rejects the job
submission. If the \fBLSF_DATA_SKIP_GROUP_CHECK=Y\fR parameter is
configured in the lsf.conf file, mbatchd does no user group
checking, and just accepts the job submission. The parameter
\fBLSF_DATA_SKIP_GROUP_CHECK=Y\fR affects only the mbatchd
daemon. User group checking is not affected by how the
\fBCACHE_ACCESS_CONTROL\fR parameter is configured in the
lsf.datamanager file.

.SH Description

.sp 2
Specify a comma-separated list of job submission environment
variables to control the propagation to the execution hosts.
.sp 2
*  Specify \fRnone\fR with no other variables to submit jobs with
   no submission environment variables. All environment variables
   are removed while submitting the job.
.sp 2
*  Specify the variable name without a value to propagate the
   environment variable with its default value.
.sp 2
*  Specify the variable name with a value to propagate the
   environment variable with the specified value to overwrite the
   default value. The specified value may either be a new value
   or quote the value of an existing environment variable (unless
   you are submitting job packs). For example:
.sp 2
   In UNIX, \fRfullpath=/tmp/:$filename\fR appends \fR/tmp/\fR to
   the beginning of the \fIfilename\fR environment variable and
   assigns this new value to the \fIfullpath\fR environment
   variable. Use a colon (\fR:\fR) to separate multiple
   environment variables.
.sp 2
   In Windows, \fRfullpath=\Temp\:%filename%\fR appends
   \fR\Temp\\fR to the beginning of the \fIfilename\fR
   environment variable and assigns this new value to the
   \fIfullpath\fR environment variable. Use a semicolon (\fR;\fR)
   to separate multiple environment variables.
.sp 2
   The shell under which you submitted the job will parse the
   quotation marks.
.sp 2
*  Specify \fRall\fR at the beginning of the list to propagate
   all existing submission environment variables to the execution
   hosts. You may also assign values to specific environment
   variables.
.sp 2
   For example, \fR-env "all, var1=value1, var2=value2"\fR
   submits jobs with all the environment variables, but with the
   specified values for the \fIvar1\fR and \fIvar2\fR environment
   variables.
.sp 2
*  When using the \fRall\fR keyword, add \fR~\fR to the beginning
   of the variable name and the environment variable is not
   propagated to the execution hosts.
.sp 2
The environment variable names cannot contain the following words
and symbols: "\fRnone\fR", "\fRall\fR", comma (\fR,\fR), tilde
(\fR~\fR), equals sign (\fR=\fR), double quotation mark (\fR"\fR)
and single quotation mark (\fR\(aq\fR).
.sp 2
The variable value can contain a tilde (\fR~\fR) and a comma
(\fR,\fR). However, if the value contains a comma (\fR,\fR), the
entire value must be enclosed in single quotation marks. For
example:
.sp 2
\fRbsub -env "TEST=\(aqA, B\(aq "\fR
.sp 2
An esub can change the -env environment variables by writing them
to the file specified by the \fBLSB_SUB_MODIFY_FILE\fR or
\fBLSF_SUB4_SUB_ENV_VARS\fR environment variables. If both
environment variables are specified, \fBLSF_SUB_MODIFY_FILE\fR
takes effect.
.sp 2
When -env is not specified with bsub, the default value is
\fR-env "all"\fR (that is, all environment variables are
submitted with the default values).
.sp 2
The entire argument for the -env option may contain a maximum of
4094 characters for UNIX and Linux, or up to 255 characters for
Windows.
.sp 2
If -env conflicts with -L, the value of -L takes effect.
.sp 2
The following environment variables are not propagated to
execution hosts because they are only used in the submission
host:
.sp 2
*  HOME, LS_JOBPID, LSB_ACCT_MAP, LSB_EXIT_PRE_ABORT,
   LSB_EXIT_REQUEUE, LSB_EVENT_ATTRIB, LSB_HOSTS,
   LSB_INTERACTIVE, LSB_INTERACTIVE_SSH, LSB_INTERACTIVE_TTY,

   LSB_JOB_STARTER, LSB_QUEUE, LSB_RESTART, LSB_TRAPSIGS,
   LSB_XJOB_SSH, LSF_VERSION, PWD, USER, VIRTUAL_HOSTNAME, and
   all variables with starting with LSB_SUB_
.sp 2
*  Environment variables about non-interactive jobs: TERM,
   TERMCAP
.sp 2
*  Windows-specific environment variables: COMPUTERNAME, COMSPEC,
   NTRESKIT, OS2LIBPATH, PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE,
   PROCESSOR_IDENTIFIER, PROCESSOR_LEVEL, PROCESSOR_REVISION,
   SYSTEMDRIVE, SYSTEMROOT, TEMP, TMP
.sp 2
The following environment variables do not take effect on the
execution hosts: LSB_DEFAULTPROJECT, LSB_DEFAULT_JOBGROUP,
LSB_TSJOB_ENVNAME, LSB_TSJOB_PASSWD, LSF_DISPLAY_ALL_TSC,
LSF_JOB_SECURITY_LABEL, LSB_DEFAULT_USERGROUP,

LSF sends the job-level eligible pending time limit configuration
to IBM Spectrum LSF RTM (LSF RTM), which handles the alarm and
triggered actions such as user notification (for example,
notifying the user that submitted the job and the LSF
administrator) and job control actions (for example, killing the
job). LSF RTM compares the job\(aqs eligible pending time to the
eligible pending time limit, and if the job is in an eligible
pending state for longer than this specified time limit, LSF RTM
triggers the alarm and actions. Without LSF RTM, LSF shows the
pending time limit and takes no action on the pending time limit.
.sp 2
In MultiCluster job forwarding mode, the job\(aqs eligible pending
time limit is ignored in the execution cluster, while the
submission cluster merges the job\(aqs queue-, application-, and

For example, Linux hosts and SGI VCPUSET hosts running CPUSET can

runs either on Linux hosts or CPUSET hosts. If external scheduler
options are not defined, the job may run on a Linux host but it
does not run on a CPUSET host.
.sp 2
The options set by -extsched can be combined with the queue-level
\fBMANDATORY_EXTSCHED\fR or \fBDEFAULT_EXTSCHED\fR parameters. If
-extsched and \fBMANDATORY_EXTSCHED\fR set the same option, the

         the job starts. Overwrites the remote file if it exists.
.sp 2
         \fR<\fR Copies the remote file to the local file after

         exists.
.sp 2
         \fR<<\fR Appends the remote file to the local file after
         the job completes. The local file must exist.
.sp 2
         \fR><\fR Copies the local file to the remote file before
         the job starts. Overwrites the remote file if it exists.
         Then copies the remote file to the local file after the
         job completes. Overwrites the local file.
.sp 2
         \fR<>\fR Copies the local file to the remote file before
         the job starts. Overwrites the remote file if it exists.
         Then copies the remote file to the local file after the
         job completes. Overwrites the local file.
.sp 2
All of the above involve copying the files to the output
directory defined in \fBDEFAULT_JOB_OUTDIR\fR or with bsub
-outdir instead of the submission directory, as long as the path
is relative. The output directory is created at the start of the
job, and also applies to jobs that are checkpointed, migrated,
requeued or rerun.
.sp 2
If you use the -i \fIinput_file \fRoption, then you do not have
to use the -f option to copy the specified input file to the
execution host. LSF does this for you, and removes the input file
from the execution host after the job completes.
.sp 2
If you use the -o \fIout_file\fR,-e \fIerr_file\fR, -oo
\fIout_file\fR, or the -eo \fIerr_file\fR option, and you want
the specified file to be copied back to the submission host when
the job completes, then you must use the -f option.
.sp 2
If the submission and execution hosts have different directory
structures, you must make sure that the directory where the
remote file and local file are placed exists.
.sp 2
If the local and remote hosts have different file name spaces,
you must always specify relative path names. If the local and
remote hosts do not share the same file system, you must make
sure that the directory containing the remote file exists. It is
recommended that only the file name be given for the remote file
when running in heterogeneous file systems. This places the file
in the job\(aqs current working directory. If the file is shared
between the submission and execution hosts, then no file copy is
performed.
.sp 2
LSF uses lsrcp to transfer files (see lsrcp(1) command). lsrcp
contacts RES on the remote host to perform the file transfer. If
RES is not available, rcp is used (see rcp(1)). The user must
make sure that the rcp binary is in the user\(aqs $PATH on the
execution host.
.sp 2
Jobs that are submitted from LSF client hosts should specify the
-f option only if rcp is allowed. Similarly, rcp must be allowed
if account mapping is used.

         If there are no GPU requirements defined in the cluster,
         queue, or application level, the default value is
         \fR"num=1:mode=shared:mps=no:j_exclusive=no"\fR.
.sp 2
\fBnum=\fInum_gpus\fB[/task | host]\fR
.br
         The number of physical GPUs required by the job. By
         default, the number is per host. You can also specify
         that the number is per task by specifying \fR/task\fR
         after the number.
.sp 2
         If you specified that the number is per task, the
         configuration of the \fRngpus_physical\fR resource in
         the lsb.resources file is set to \fRPER_TASK\fR, or the
         \fBRESOURCE_RESERVE_PER_TASK=Y\fR parameter is set in
         the lsb.params file, this number is the requested count
         per task.
.sp 2
\fBmode=shared | exclusive_process\fR
.br
         The GPU mode when the job is running, either shared or
         exclusive_process. The default mode is shared.
.sp 2
         The shared mode corresponds to the Nvidia or AMD DEFAULT
         compute mode. The exclusive_process mode corresponds to
         the Nvidia EXCLUSIVE_PROCESS compute mode.
.sp 2
         \fBNote: \fR Do not specify exclusive_process when you
         are using AMD GPUs (that is, when gvendor=amd is
         specified).
.sp 2
\fBmps=yes[,nocvd][,shared] | no\fR
.br
         Enables or disables the Nvidia Multi-Process Service
         (MPS) for the GPUs that are allocated to the job. Using
         MPS effectively causes the EXCLUSIVE_PROCESS mode to
         behave like the DEFAULT mode for all MPS clients. MPS
         always allows multiple clients to use the GPU through
         the MPS server.
.sp 2
         \fBNote: \fRTo avoid inconsistent behavior, do not
         enable mps when you are using AMD GPUs (that is, when
         gvendor=amd is specified). If the result of merging the
         GPU requirements at the cluster, queue, application, and
         job levels is gvendor=amd and mps is enabled (for
         example, if gvendor=amd is specified at the job level
         without specifying mps=no, but mps=yes is specified at
         the application, queue, or cluster level), LSF ignores
         the mps requirement.
.sp 2
         MPS is useful for both shared and exclusive process
         GPUs, and allows more efficient sharing of GPU resources
         and better GPU utilization. See the Nvidia documentation
         for more information and limitations.
.sp 2
         When using MPS, use the EXCLUSIVE_PROCESS mode to ensure
         that only a single MPS server is using the GPU, which
         provides additional insurance that the MPS server is the
         single point of arbitration between all CUDA process for
         that GPU.
.sp 2
         You can also enable MPS daemon sharing by adding the
         \fBshare\fR keyword with a comma and no space (for
         example, \fRmps=yes,shared\fR enables MPS daemon sharing
         on the host). If sharing is enabled, all jobs that are
         submitted by the same user with the same resource
         requirements share the same MPS daemon on the host,
         socket, or GPU.
.sp 2
         \fBImportant: \fRUsing EXCLUSIVE_THREAD mode with MPS is
         not supported and might cause unexpected behavior.
.sp 2
\fBj_exclusive=yes | no\fR
.br
         Specifies whether the allocated GPUs can be used by
         other jobs. When the mode is set to exclusive_process,
         the j_exclusive=yes option is set automatically.
.sp 2
\fBblock=yes | no\fR
.br
         Specifies whether to enable block distribution, that is,
         to distribute the allocated GPUs of a job as blocks when
         the number of tasks is greater than the requested number
         of GPUs. If set to \fRyes\fR, LSF distributes all the
         allocated GPUs of a job as blocks when the number of
         tasks is bigger than the requested number of GPUs. By
         default, \fRblock=no\fR is set so that allocated GPUs
         are not distributed as blocks.
.sp 2
         For example, if a GPU job requests to run on a host with
         4 GPUs and 40 tasks, block distribution assigns GPU0 for
         ranks 0-9, GPU1 for ranks 10-19, GPU2 for tanks 20-29,
         and GPU3 for ranks 30-39.
.sp 2
         \fBNote: \fRThe \fRblock=yes\fR setting conflicts with
         \fRaff=yes\fR (strict CPU-GPU affinity binding). This is
         because strict CPU-GPU binding allocates GPUs to tasks
         based on the CPU NUMA ID, which conflicts with the
         distribution of allocated GPUs as blocks. If
         \fRblock=yes\fR and \fRaff=yes\fR are both specified in
         the GPU requirements string, the \fRblock=yes\fR setting
         takes precedence and strict CPU-GPU affinity binding is
         disabled (that is, \fRaff=no\fR is automatically set).
.sp 2
\fBgpack=yes | no\fR
.br
         For shared mode jobs only. Specifies whether to enable
         pack scheduling. If set to \fRyes\fR, LSF packs multiple
         shared mode GPU jobs to allocated GPUs. LSF schedules
         shared mode GPUs as follows:
.sp 2
         1. LSF sorts the candidate hosts (from largest to
            smallest) based on the number of shared GPUs that
            already have running jobs, then by the number of GPUs
            that are not exclusive.
.sp 2
            If the order[] keyword is defined in the resource
            requirements string, after sorting order[], LSF
            re-sorts the candidate hosts by the gpack policy (by
            shared GPUs that already have running jobs first,
            then by the number of GPUs that are not exclusive).
            The gpack policy sort priority is higher than the
            order[] sort.
.sp 2
         2. LSF sorts the candidate GPUs on each host (from
            largest to smallest) based on the number of running
            jobs.
.sp 2
         After scheduling, the shared mode GPU job packs to the
         allocated shared GPU that is sorted first, not to a new
         shared GPU.
.sp 2
         If Docker attribute affinity is enabled, the order of
         candidate hosts are sorted by Docker attribute affinity
         before sorting by GPUs.
.sp 2
         By default, \fRgpack=no\fR is set so that pack
         scheduling is disabled.
.sp 2
\fBgvendor=amd | nvidia\fR
.br
         Specifies the GPU vendor type. LSF allocates GPUs with
         the specified vendor type.
.sp 2
         Specify \fRamd\fR to request AMD GPUs, or specify
         \fRnvidia\fR to request Nvidia GPUs.
.sp 2
         By default, LSF requests Nvidia GPUs.
.sp 2
\fBgmodel=\fImodel_name\fB[-\fImem_size\fB]\fR
.br
         Specifies GPUs with the specific model name and,
         optionally, its total GPU memory. By default, LSF
         allocates the GPUs with the same model, if available.
.sp 2
         The \fBgmodel\fR keyword supports the following formats:
.sp 2
         \fBgmodel=\fImodel_name\fB\fR
.br
                  Requests GPUs with the specified brand and
                  model name (for example, TeslaK80).
.sp 2
         \fBgmodel=\fIshort_model_name\fB\fR
.br
                  Requests GPUs with a specific brand name (for
                  example, Tesla, Quadro, NVS, ) or model type
                  name (for example, K80, P100).
.sp 2
         \fBgmodel=\fImodel_name\fB-\fImem_size\fB\fR
.br
                  Requests GPUs with the specified brand name and
                  total GPU memory size. The GPU memory size
                  consists of the number and its unit, which
                  includes \fRM\fR, \fRG\fR, \fRT\fR, \fRMB\fR,
                  \fRGB\fR, and \fRTB\fR (for example,
                  \fR12G\fR).
.sp 2
         To find the available GPU model names on each host, run
         the lsload –gpuload, lshosts –gpu, or bhosts -gpu
         commands. The model name string does not contain space
         characters. In addition, the slash (\fR/\fR) and hyphen
         (\fR-\fR) characters are replaced with the underscore
         character (\fR_\fR). For example, the GPU model name
         “\fRTesla C2050 / C2070\fR” is converted to
         “\fRTeslaC2050_C2070\fR” in LSF.
.sp 2
\fBgmem=\fImem_value\fB\fR
.br
         Specify the GPU memory on each GPU required by the job.
         The format of \fImem_value\fR is the same to other
         resource value (for example, \fRmem\fR or \fRswap\fR) in
         the rusage section of the job resource requirements
         (-R).
.sp 2
\fBgtile=! | \fItile_num\fB\fR
.br
         Specifies the number of GPUs per socket. Specify an
         number to explicitly define the number of GPUs per
         socket on the host, or specify an exclamation mark
         (\fR!\fR) to enable LSF to automatically calculate the
         number, which evenly divides the GPUs along all sockets
         on the host. LSF guarantees the \fBgtile\fR requirements
         even for affinity jobs. This means that LSF might not
         allocate the GPU\(aqs affinity to the allocated CPUs when
         the \fBgtile\fR requirements cannot be satisfied.
.sp 2
         If the \fBgtile\fR keyword is not specified for an
         affinity job, LSF attempts to allocate enough GPUs on
         the sockets that allocated GPUs. If there are not enough
         GPUs on the optimal sockets, jobs cannot go to this
         host.
.sp 2
         If the \fBgtile\fR keyword is not specified for a
         non-affinity job, LSF attempts to allocate enough GPUs
         on the same socket. If this is not available, LSF might
         allocate GPUs on separate GPUs.
.sp 2
\fBnvlink=yes\fR
.br
         Obsolete in LSF, Version 10.1 Fix Pack 11. Use the
         \fBglink\fR keyword instead. Enables the job enforcement
         for NVLink connections among GPUs. LSF allocates GPUs
         with NVLink connections in force.
.sp 2
\fBglink=yes\fR
.br
         Enables job enforcement for special connections among
         GPUs. LSF must allocate GPUs with the special
         connections that are specific to the GPU vendor.
.sp 2
         If the job requests AMD GPUs, LSF must allocate GPUs
         with the xGMI connection. If the job requests Nvidia
         GPUs, LSF must allocate GPUs with the NVLink connection.
.sp 2
         Do not use \fBglink\fR together with the obsolete
         \fBnvlink\fR keyword.
.sp 2
         By default, LSF can allocate GPUs without special
         connections when there are not enough GPUs with these
         connections.
.sp 2
\fBmig=\fIGI_size\fB[/\fICI_size\fB]\fR
.br
         Specifies Nvidia Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) device
         requirements.
.sp 2
         Specify the requested number of GPU instances for the
         MIG job. Valid GPU instance sizes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 7.
.sp 2
         Optionally, specify the requested number of compute
         instances after the specified GPU instance size and a
         slash character (\fR/\fR). The requested compute
         instance size must be less than or equal to the
         requested GPU instance size. In addition, Nvidia MIG
         does not support the following GPU/compute instance size
         combinations: 4/3, 7/5, 7/6. If this is not specified,
         the default compute instance size is 1.
.sp 2
The syntax of the GPU requirement in the -gpu option is the same
as the syntax in the \fBLSB_GPU_REQ\fR parameter in the lsf.conf
file and the \fBGPU_REQ\fR parameter in the lsb.queues and
lsb.applications files.
.sp 2
\fBNote: \fRThe bjobs output does not show \fRaff=yes\fR even if
you specify \fRaff=yes\fR in the bsub -gpu option.
.sp 2
If the \fBGPU_REQ_MERGE\fR parameter is defined as \fRY\fR or
\fRy\fR in the lsb.params file and a GPU requirement is specified
at multiple levels (at least two of the default cluster, queue,
application profile, or job level requirements), each option of
the GPU requirement is merged separately. Job level overrides
application level, which overrides queue level, which overrides
the default cluster GPU requirement. For example, if the mode
option of the GPU requirement is defined on the -gpu option, and
the mps option is defined in the queue, the mode of job level and
the mps value of queue is used.
.sp 2
If the \fBGPU_REQ_MERGE\fR parameter is not defined as \fRY\fR or
\fRy\fR in the lsb.params file and a GPU requirement is specified
at multiple levels (at least two of the default cluster, queue,
application profile, or job level requirements), the entire GPU
requirement string is replaced. The entire job level GPU
requirement string overrides application level, which overrides
queue level, which overrides the default GPU requirement.
.sp 2
The esub parameter \fBLSB_SUB4_GPU_REQ\fR modifies the value of
the -gpu option.
.sp 2
LSF selects the GPU that meets the topology requirement first. If
the GPU mode of the selected GPU is not the requested mode, LSF
changes the GPU to the requested mode. For example, if LSF
allocates an \fRexclusive_process\fR GPU to a job that needs a
shared GPU, LSF changes the GPU mode to shared before the job
starts and then changes the mode back to \fRexclusive_process\fR
when the job finishes.
.sp 2
The GPU requirements are converted to rusage resource
requirements for the job. For example, \fRnum=2\fR is converted
to \fRrusage[ngpus_physical=2]\fR. Use the bjobs, bhist, and
bacct commands to see the merged resource requirement.
.sp 2
There might be complex GPU requirements that the bsub -gpu option
and \fBGPU_REQ\fR parameter syntax cannot cover, including
compound GPU requirements (for different GPU requirements for
jobs on different hosts, or for different parts of a parallel
job) and alternate GPU requirements (if more than one set of GPU
requirements might be acceptable for a job to run). For complex
GPU requirements, use the bsub -R command option, or the
\fBRES_REQ\fR parameter in the lsb.applications or lsb.queues
file to define the resource requirement string.
.sp 2
\fBImportant: \fRYou can define the mode, j_exclusive, and mps
options only with the -gpu option, the \fBLSB_GPU_REQ\fR
parameter in the lsf.conf file, or the \fBGPU_REQ\fR parameter in
the lsb.queues or lsb.applications files. You cannot use these
options with the rusage resource requirement string in the bsub
-R command option or the \fBRES_REQ\fR parameter in the
lsb.queues or lsb.applications files.
.SH Examples

.sp 2
The following job request does not override the effective GPU
requirement with job-level GPU requirements. The effective GPU
requirement is merged together from GPU requirements that are

Application profile level overrides queue level, which overrides
the cluster level default GPU requirement.

.SH Description

.sp 2
When -hl is specified, a memory limit specified at the job level
by -M or by \fBMEMLIMIT\fR in lsb.queues or lsb.applications is
enforced by the Linux cgroup subsystem on a per-job basis on each
host. Similarly, a swap limit specified at the job level by -v or
by \fBSWAPLIMIT\fR in lsb.queues or lsb.applications is enforced
by the Linux cgroup subsystem on a per-job basis on each host.
Host-based memory and swap limits are enforced regardless of the
number of tasks running on the execution host. The -hl option
only applies to memory and swap limits; it does not apply to any
other resource usage limits.
.sp 2
\fBLSB_RESOURCE_ENFORCE="memory"\fR must be specified in lsf.conf
for host-based memory and swap limit enforcement with the -hl
option to take effect. If no memory or swap limit is specified
for the job (the merged limit for the job, queue, and application
profile, if specified), or \fBLSB_RESOURCE_ENFORCE="memory"\fR is
not specified, a host-based memory limit is not set for the job.
.sp 2
When \fBLSB_RESOURCE_ENFORCE="memory"\fR is configured in
lsf.conf, and memory and swap limits are specified for the job,
but -hl is \fInot\fR specified, memory and swap limits are
calculated and enforced as a multiple of the number of tasks
running on the execution host.

\fIres-req\fR.
.SH Description

.sp 2
When submitting a job, you can point the job to a file that
specifies hosts and number of slots for job processing.
.sp 2
For example, some applications (typically when benchmarking) run
best with a very specific geometry. For repeatability (again,
typically when benchmarking) you may want it to always run it on
the same hosts, using the same number of slots.
.sp 2
The user-specified host file specifies a host and number of slots
to use per task, resulting in a rank file.
.sp 2
The -hostfile option allows a user to submit a job, specifying
the path of the user-specified host file:
.sp 2
bsub -hostfile "spec_host_file"
.sp 2
\fBImportant: \fR
.sp 2
*  Do not use a user-specified host file if you have enabled task
   geometry as it may cause conflicts and jobs may fail.
.sp 2
*  Alternatively, if resources are not available at the time that
   a task is ready a job may not run smoothly. Consider using
   advance reservation instead of a user-specified host file, to
   ensure reserved slots are available.
.sp 2
Any user can create a user-specified host file. It must be
accessible by the user from the submission host. It lists one
host per line. The format is as follows:
.sp 2
# This is a user-specified host file
.br
<host_name1>   [<# slots>]
.br
<host_name2>   [<# slots>]
.br
<host_name1>   [<# slots>]
.br
<host_name2>   [<# slots>]
.br
<host_name3>   [<# slots>]
.br
<host_name4>   [<# slots>]
.sp 2
The following rules apply to the user-specified host file:
.sp 2
*  Insert comments starting with the # character.
.sp 2
*  Specifying the number of slots for a host is optional. If no
   slot number is indicated, the default is 1.
.sp 2
*  A host name can be either a host in a local cluster or a host
   leased-in from a remote cluster
   (\fIhost_name\fR@\fIcluster_name\fR).
.sp 2
*  A user-specified host file should contain hosts from the same
   cluster only.
.sp 2
*  A host name can be entered with or without the domain name.
.sp 2
*  Host names may be used multiple times and the order entered
   represents the placement of tasks. For example:
.sp 2
   #first three tasks
.br
   host01                      3
.br
   #fourth tasks
.br
   host02
.br
   #next three tasks
.br
   host03                      3
.br

.sp 2
The resulting rank file is made available to other applications
(such as MPI).
.sp 2
The \fBLSB_DJOB_RANKFILE\fR environment variable is generated
from the user-specified host file. If a job is not submitted with
a user-specified host file then \fBLSB_DJOB_RANKFILE\fR points to
the same file as \fBLSB_DJOB_HOSTFILE\fR.
.sp 2
The esub parameter \fBLSB_SUB4_HOST_FILE\fR reads and modifies
the value of the -hostfile option.
.sp 2
The following is an example of a user-specified host file that
includes duplicate host names:
.sp 2
user1: cat ./user1_host_file
.br
# This is my user-specified host file for job242
.br
host01   3
.br
host02    
.br
host03   3
.br
host01    
.br
host02   2
.br

.sp 2
This user-specified host file tells LSF to allocate 10 slots in
total (4 slots on \fRhost01\fR, 3 slots on \fRhost02\fR, and 3
slots on \fRhost03\fR). Each line represents the order of task
placement.
.sp 2
Duplicate host names are combined, along with the total number of
slots for a host name and the results are used for scheduling
(whereas \fBLSB_DJOB_HOSTFILE\fR groups the hosts together) and
for \fBLSB_MCPU_HOSTS\fR. \fBLSB_MCPU_HOSTS\fR represents the job
allocation.
.sp 2
The result is the following:

.sp 2
If the file exists on the execution host, LSF uses it. Otherwise,
LSF attempts to copy the file from the submission host to the

submission host to a temporary file in the directory specified by
the \fBJOB_SPOOL_DIR\fR parameter in lsb.params, or your
$HOME/.lsbatch directory on the execution host. LSF removes this
file when the job completes.
.sp 2
By default, the input file is spooled to
LSB_SHAREDIR/\fIcluster_name\fR/lsf_indir. If the lsf_indir
directory does not exist, LSF creates it before spooling the

.sp 2
The -jobaff command option uses one of the following keywords to
specify the affinity preferences for the job:
.sp 2
\fB[! | # | ~]\fIattribute_name\fB ...\fR
.br
         Use no keywords to specify the preferences for hosts on
         which LSF would run the current job based on host
         attributes. Use a space to separate multiple attributes.
         Specifying the following special characters before the
         attribute name indicates the following preferences:
.sp 2
         *  Default (no special character): It is preferred for
            the host to have this attribute.
.sp 2
         *  \fR!\fR: It is preferred for the host to not have
            this attribute.
.sp 2
         *  \fR#\fR: It is mandatory for the host to have this
            attribute.
.sp 2
         *  \fR~\fR: It is mandatory for the host to not have
            this attribute.
.sp 2
\fBattribute([! | # | ~]\fIattribute_name\fB ...)\fR
.br
         Using the \fBattribute\fR keyword is the same as using
         no keywords (that is, using the \fBattribute\fR keyword
         specifies the preferences for hosts on which LSF would
         run the current job based on host attributes).
.sp 2
\fB[! | # | ~]samehost(\fIjob_id\fB)\fR
.br
         Use the \fBsamehost\fR keyword to specify the preference
         for the job to run on the same host on which another job
         with the specified job ID runs. The job ID can be a
         simple job or array job element, but you cannot specify
         multiple job IDs. The \fBSAME_JOB_AFFINITY\fR parameter
         must be set to \fRY\fR or \fRy\fR in the lsb.params file
         to use the \fBsamehost\fR keyword.
.sp 2
         Specifying the following special characters before the
         \fBsamehost\fR keyword indicates the following
         preferences:
.sp 2
         *  Default (no special character): It is preferred for
            the job to run on the same host on which the
            specified job runs.
.sp 2
         *  \fR!\fR: It is preferred for the job to not run on
            the same host on which the specified job runs.
.sp 2
         *  \fR#\fR: It is mandatory for the job to run on the
            same host on which the specified job runs.
.sp 2
         *  \fR~\fR: It is mandatory for the job to not run on
            the same host on which the specified job runs.
.sp 2
\fB[! | # | ~]samecu(\fIjob_id\fB)\fR
.br
         Use the \fBsamecu\fR keyword to specify the preference
         for the job to run on a compute unit on which another
         job with the specified job ID runs. The job ID can be a
         simple job or array job element, but you cannot specify
         multiple job IDs. The \fBSAME_JOB_AFFINITY\fR parameter
         must be set to \fRY\fR or \fRy\fR in the lsb.params file
         to use the \fBsamecu\fR keyword.

\fBNote: \fRIf you submit a job with a \fBsamehost\fR or
\fBsamecu\fR affinity for a job that is finished and there are no
other unfinished jobs that reference this finished job at
submission time, LSF cleans the finished job\(aqs allocation host
information from the job scheduler. With no host allocation
information for the finished job, your job submission with
mandatory \fBsamehost\fR or \fBsamecu\fR requirements would pend
indefinitely, and if your job submission has a preferred
\fBsamehost\fR or \fBsamecu\fR requirement, the preferred
requirement is ignored.

Use the battr create command to create attributes on hosts.

.SH Description

.sp 2
LSF provides an extension to the JSDL specification so that you
can submit jobs using LSF features not defined in the JSDL
standard schema. The JSDL schema (jsdl.xsd), the POSIX extension
(jsdl-posix.xsd), and the LSF extension (jsdl-lsf.xsd) are
located in the LSF_LIBDIR directory.
.sp 2
*  To submit a job that uses the LSF extension, use the -jsdl
   option.
.sp 2
*  To submit a job that uses only standard JSDL elements and
   POSIX extensions, use the -jsdl_strict option. You can use the
   -jsdl_strict option to verify that your file contains only
   valid JSDL elements and POSIX extensions. Error messages
   indicate invalid elements, including:
.sp 2
   *  Elements that are not part of the JSDL specification
.sp 2
   *  Valid JSDL elements that are not supported in this version
      of LSF
.sp 2
   *  Extension elements that are not part of the JSDL standard
      and POSIX extension schemas
.sp 2
For more information about submitting jobs using JSDL, including
a detailed mapping of JSDL elements to LSF submission options,
and a complete list of supported and unsupported elements, refer
to Submitting jobs using JSDL in Administering IBM Spectrum LSF.
.sp 2
If you specify duplicate or conflicting job submission
parameters, LSF resolves the conflict by applying the following
rules:
.sp 2
1. The parameters that are specified in the command line override
   all other parameters.
.sp 2
2. The parameters that are specified in the JSDL file override
   the job script.

.SH Description

.sp 2
Specify a relative or absolute path name. The quotes (") are
required if you specify a checkpoint period, initial checkpoint
period, or custom checkpoint and restart method name.
.sp 2
The job ID and job file name are concatenated to the checkpoint
dir when creating a checkpoint file.
.sp 2
\fBNote: \fRThe file path of the checkpoint directory can contain
up to 4000 characters for UNIX and Linux, or up to 255 characters
for Windows, including the directory and file name.
.sp 2
When a job is checkpointed, the checkpoint information is stored
in \fIcheckpoint_dir\fR/\fIjob_ID\fR/\fIfile_name\fR. Multiple
jobs can checkpoint into the same directory. The system can
create multiple files.
.sp 2
The checkpoint directory is used for restarting the job (see
brestart(1)). The checkpoint directory can be any valid path.
.sp 2
Optionally, specifies a checkpoint period in minutes. Specify a
positive integer. The running job is checkpointed automatically
every checkpoint period. The checkpoint period can be changed
using bchkpnt. Because checkpointing is a heavyweight operation,
you should choose a checkpoint period greater than half an hour.
.sp 2
Optionally, specifies an initial checkpoint period in minutes.
Specify a positive integer. The first checkpoint does not happen
until the initial period has elapsed. After the first checkpoint,
the job checkpoint frequency is controlled by the normal job
checkpoint interval.
.sp 2
The echkpnt.\fRmethod_name\fR and erestart.\fImethod_name\fR
programs must be in LSF_SERVERDIR or in the directory specified
by \fBLSB_ECHKPNT_METHOD_DIR\fR (environment variable or set in
lsf.conf).
.sp 2
If a custom checkpoint and restart method is already specified
with \fBLSB_ECHKPNT_METHOD\fR (environment variable or in
lsf.conf), the method you specify with bsub -k overrides this.
.sp 2
Process checkpointing is not available on all host types, and may
require linking programs with a special libraries (see
libckpt.a(3)). LSF invokes echkpnt (see echkpnt(8)) found in
\fBLSF_SERVERDIR\fR to checkpoint the job. You can override the
default echkpnt for the job by defining as environment variables
or in lsf.conf \fBLSB_ECHKPNT_METHOD\fR and
\fBLSB_ECHKPNT_METHOD_DIR\fR to point to your own echkpnt. This
allows you to use other checkpointing facilities, including
application-level checkpointing.
.sp 2
The checkpoint method directory should be accessible by all users
who need to run the custom echkpnt and erestart programs.
.sp 2
Only running members of a chunk job can be checkpointed.

.SH Description

.sp 2
By default, if multiple hosts are candidates, runs the job on the
least-loaded host.
.sp 2
When a compute unit requirement is specified along with a host,
host group, or compute unit preference, these preferences will
affect the order of a compute unit. The highest preference of
hosts within the compute unit is taken as the preference of this
compute unit. Thus, the compute unit containing the highest
preference host will be considered first. In addition, the job
will be rejected unless:
.sp 2
*  A host in the list belongs to a compute unit, and
.sp 2
*  A host in the first execution list belongs to a compute unit.
.sp 2
When used with a compound resource requirement, the first host
allocated must satisfy the simple resource requirement string
appearing first in the compound resource requirement.
.sp 2
To change the order of preference, put a plus (+) after the names
of hosts or host groups that you would prefer to use, optionally
followed by a preference level. For preference level, specify a
positive integer, with higher numbers indicating greater
preferences for those hosts. For example, -m "hostA groupB+2
hostC+1" indicates that \fRgroupB\fR is the most preferred and
\fRhostA\fR is the least preferred.
.sp 2
The keyword \fRothers\fR can be specified with or without a
preference level to refer to other hosts not otherwise listed.
The keyword \fRothers\fR must be specified with at least one host
name or host group, it cannot be specified by itself. For
example, -m "hostA+ others" means that \fRhostA\fR is preferred
over all other hosts.
.sp 2
If you also use -q, the specified queue must be configured to
include at least a partial list of the hosts in your host list.
Otherwise, the job is not submitted. To find out what hosts are
configured for the queue, use bqueues -l.
.sp 2
If the host group contains the keyword \fRall\fR, LSF dispatches
the job to any available host, even if the host is not defined
for the specified queue.
.sp 2
To display configured host groups and compute units, use bmgroup.
.sp 2
For the job forwarding model with the LSF multicluster
capability, specify a remote host using
\fIhost_name\fR\fR@\fR\fIcluster_name\fR and change the order of
preference by using the plus (\fR+\fR) sign.
.sp 2
For parallel jobs, specify first execution host candidates when
you want to ensure that a host has the required resources or
runtime environment to handle processes that run on the first
execution host.
.sp 2
To specify one or more hosts or host groups as first execution
host candidates, add an exclamation point (\fR!\fR) after the
host name, as shown in the following example:
.sp 2
\fRbsub -n 2 -m "host1 host2! hostgroupA! host3 host4"
my_parallel_job\fR
.sp 2
In this example, LSF runs \fRmy_parallel_job\fR according to the
following steps:
.sp 2
1. LSF selects either host2 or a host defined in \fRhostgroupA\fR
   as the first execution host for the parallel job.
.sp 2
   \fBNote: \fRFirst execution host candidates specified at the
   job-level (command line) override candidates defined at the
   queue level (in lsb.queues).
.sp 2
2. If any of the first execution host candidates have enough
   processors to run the job, the entire job runs on the first
   execution host, and not on any other hosts.
.sp 2
   In the example, if \fRhost2\fR or a member of \fRhostgroupA\fR
   has two or more processors, the entire job runs on the first
   execution host.
.sp 2
3. If the first execution host does not have enough processors to
   run the entire job, LSF selects additional hosts that are not
   defined as first execution host candidates.
.sp 2
   Follow these guidelines when you specify first execution host
   candidates:
.sp 2
   *  If you specify a host group, you must first define the host
      group in the file lsb.hosts.
.sp 2
   *  Do not specify a dynamic host group as a first execution
      host.
.sp 2
   *  Do not specify all, allremote, or others, or a host
      partition as a first execution host.
.sp 2
   *  Do not specify a preference (\fR+\fR) for a host identified
      as a first execution host candidate (using \fR!\fR).
.sp 2
   *  For each parallel job, specify enough regular hosts to
      satisfy the processor requirement for the job. Once LSF
      selects a first execution host for the current job, the
      other first execution host candidates become unavailable to
      the current job, but remain available to other jobs as
      either regular or first execution hosts.
.sp 2
   *  You cannot specify first execution host candidates when you
      use the brun command.
.sp 2
When using the LSF multicluster capability, insert an exclamation
point (\fR!\fR) after the cluster name, as shown in the following
example:
.sp 2
\fRbsub -n 2 -m "host2@cluster2! host3@cluster2"
my_parallel_job\fR
.sp 2
When specifying compute units, the job runs within the listed
compute units. Used in conjunction with a mandatory first
execution host, the compute unit containing the first execution
host is given preference.
.sp 2
In the following example one host from host group \fRhg\fR
appears first, followed by other hosts within the same compute
unit. Remaining hosts from other compute units appear grouped by
compute, and in the same order as configured in the ComputeUnit
section of lsb.hosts.

\fBbsub -n\fR min_tasks[\fB,\fRmax_tasks]
.SH Description

.sp 2
The number of tasks is used to allocate a number of slots for the
job. Usually, the number of slots assigned to a job will equal
the number of tasks specified. For example, one task will be
allocated with one slot. (Some slots/processors may be on the
same multiprocessor host).
.sp 2
You can specify a minimum and maximum number of tasks. For
example, this job requests a minimum of 4, but can launch up to 6
tasks:
.sp 2
\fRbsub -n 4,6 a.out\fR
.sp 2
The job can start if at least the minimum number of
slots/processors is available for the minimum number of tasks
specified. If you do not specify a maximum number of tasks, the
number you specify represents the exact number of tasks to
launch.
.sp 2
If \fBPARALLEL_SCHED_BY_SLOT=Y\fR in lsb.params, this option
specifies the number of slots required to run the job, not the
number of processors.
.sp 2
When used with the -R option and a compound resource requirement,
the number of slots in the compound resource requirement must be
compatible with the minimum and maximum tasks specified.
.sp 2
Jobs that have fewer tasks than the minimum \fBTASKLIMIT\fR
defined for the queue or application profile to which the job is
submitted, or more tasks than the maximum \fBTASKLIMIT\fR are
rejected. If the job has minimum and maximum tasks, the maximum
tasks requested cannot be less than the minimum \fBTASKLIMIT\fR,
and the minimum tasks requested cannot be more than the maximum
\fBTASKLIMIT\fR.
.sp 2
For example, if the queue defines \fRTASKLIMIT=4 8\fR:
.sp 2
*  bsub -n 6 is accepted because it requests slots within the
   range of \fBTASKLIMIT\fR
.sp 2
*  bsub -n 9 is rejected because it requests more tasks than the
   \fBTASKLIMIT\fR allows
.sp 2
*  bsub -n 1 is rejected because it requests fewer tasks than the
   \fBTASKLIMIT\fR allows
.sp 2
*  bsub -n 6,10 is accepted because the minimum value 6 is within
   the range of the \fBTASKLIMIT\fR setting
.sp 2
*  bsub -n 1,6 is accepted because the maximum value 6 is within
   the range of the \fBTASKLIMIT\fR setting
.sp 2
*  bsub -n 10,16 is rejected because its range is outside the
   range of \fBTASKLIMIT\fR
.sp 2
*  bsub -n 1,3 is rejected because its range is outside the range
   of \fBTASKLIMIT\fR
.sp 2
See the \fBTASKLIMIT\fR parameter in lsb.queues and
lsb.applications for more information.
.sp 2
If \fBJOB_SIZE_LIST\fR is defined in lsb.applications or
lsb.queues and a job is submitted to a queue or an application
profile with a job size list, the requested job size in the job
submission must request only a single job size (number of tasks)
rather than a minimum and maximum value and the requested job
size in the job submission must satisfy the list defined in
\fBJOB_SIZE_LIST\fR, otherwise LSF rejects the job submission. If
a job submission does not include a job size request, LSF assigns
the default job size to the submission request.
\fBJOB_SIZE_LIST\fR overrides any \fBTASKLIMIT\fR parameters
defined at the same level.
.sp 2
For example, if the application profile or queue defines
\fRJOB_SIZE_LIST=4 2 10 6 8\fR:
.sp 2
*  bsub -n 6 is accepted because it requests a job size that is
   in \fBJOB_SIZE_LIST\fR.
.sp 2
*  bsub -n 9 is rejected because it requests a job size that is
   not in \fBJOB_SIZE_LIST\fR.
.sp 2
*  bsub -n 2,8 is rejected because you cannot request a range of
   job slot sizes when \fBJOB_SIZE_LIST\fR is defined.
.sp 2
*  bsub without specifying a job size (using -n or -R) is
   accepted and the job submission is assigned a job size request
   of 4 (the default value).
.sp 2
See the \fBJOB_SIZE_LIST\fR parameter in lsb.applications(5) or
lsb.queues(5) for more information.
.sp 2
In the LSF multicluster capability environment, if a queue
exports jobs to remote clusters (see the \fBSNDJOBS_TO\fR
parameter in lsb.queues), then the process limit is not imposed
on jobs submitted to this queue.
.sp 2
Once the required number of processors is available, the job is
dispatched to the first host selected. The list of selected host
names for the job are specified in the environment variables
\fBLSB_HOSTS\fR and \fBLSB_MCPU_HOSTS\fR. The job itself is
expected to start parallel components on these hosts and
establish communication among them, optionally using RES.
.sp 2
Specify first execution host candidates using the -m option when
you want to ensure that a host has the required resources or
runtime environment to handle processes that run on the first
execution host.
.sp 2
If you specify one or more first execution host candidates, LSF
looks for a first execution host that satisfies the resource
requirements. If the first execution host does not have enough
processors or job slots to run the entire job, LSF looks for
additional hosts.

         If mode is IP and type is not specified, the job will
         only run on Ethernet adapters (IPoEth). For IPoEth jobs,
         LSF ensures the job is running on hosts where pnsd is

.br
                  The application makes only calls from a

                  protocol=myAPI or protocol=charm.
.sp 2
         The default value is mpi.
.sp 2
         LSF also supports an optional \fIprotocol_number\fR (for
         example, \fRmpi(2)\fR, which specifies the number of
         contexts (endpoints) per parallel API instance. The
         number must be a power of 2, but no greater than 128 (1,
         2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128). LSF will pass the
         communication protocols to IBM PE without any change.
         LSF will reserve network windows for each protocol.
.sp 2
         When you specify multiple parallel API protocols, you
         cannot make calls to both LAPI and PAMI (lapi, pami) or
         LAPI and OpenSHMEM (lapi, shmem) in the same

\fBmode=US | IP\fR
.br
         The network communication system mode used by the
         communication specified communication protocol: US (User
         Space) or IP (Internet Protocol). The default value is
         US. A US job can only run with adapters that support
         user space communications, such as the IB adapter. IP
         jobs can run with either Ethernet adapters or IB
         adapters. When IP mode is specified, the instance number
         cannot be specified, and network usage must be
         unspecified or shared.
.sp 2
         Each instance on the US mode requested by a task running
         on switch adapters requires and adapter window. For
         example, if a task requests both the MPI and LAPI
         protocols such that both protocol instances require US
         mode, two adapter windows will be used.
.sp 2
\fBusage=dedicated | shared\fR
.br
         Specifies whether the adapter can be shared with tasks
         of other job steps: dedicated or shared. Multiple tasks
         of the same job can share one network even if usage is
         dedicated.
.sp 2
\fBinstance=\fIpositive_integer\fB\fR
.br
         The number of parallel communication paths (windows) per
         task made available to the protocol on each network. The
         number actually used depends on the implementation of
         the protocol subsystem.
.sp 2
         The default value is 1.
.sp 2
         If the specified value is greater than
         MAX_PROTOCOL_INSTANCES in lsb.params or lsb.queues, LSF

*  %JG - job group (if not specified, it will be ignored)
.sp 2

.sp 2
*  %U - user name
.sp 2
*  %G - User group new forthe job output directory
.sp 2
*  %H - first execution host name
.sp 2
For example, the system creates the submission_dir/user1/jobid_0/
output directory for the job with the following command:
.sp 2
\fRbsub -outdir "%U/%J_%I" myprog\fR
.sp 2
If the cluster wide output directory was defined but the outdir
option was not set, for example,
\fBDEFAULT_JOB_OUTDIR\fR=/scratch/joboutdir/%U/%J_%I in
lsb.params, the system creates the
/scratch/joboutdir/user1/jobid_0/ output directory for the job
with the following command:
.sp 2
\fRbsub myprog\fR
.sp 2
If the submission directory is /scratch/joboutdir/ on the shared
file system and you want the system to create
/scratch/joboutdir/user1/jobid_0/ for the job output directory,
then run the following command:
.sp 2
\fRbsub -outdir "%U/%J_%I" myjob\fR
.sp 2
Since the command path can contain up to 4094 characters for UNIX
and Linux, or up to 255 characters for Windows, including the
directory and file name, the outdir option does not have its own
length limitation. The outdir option supports mixed UNIX and
Windows paths when \fBLSB_MIXED_PATH_ENABLE=Y/y\fR.
\fBLSB_MIXED_PATH_DELIMITER\fR controls the delimiter.
.sp 2
The following assumptions and dependencies apply to the -outdir
command option:
.sp 2
*  The execution host has access to the submission host.
.sp 2
*  The submission host should be running RES or it will use
   EGO_RSH to run a directory creation command. If this parameter
   is not defined, rsh will be used. RES should be running on the
   Windows submission host in order to create the output

.sp 2
Do not use with any other bsub option in the command line.
.SH Description

.sp 2
The purpose of the job packs feature is to speed up the
submission of a large number of jobs. When job pack submission is
enabled, you can submit jobs by submitting a single file
containing multiple job requests.
.sp 2
Specify the full path to the job submission file. The job packs
feature must be enabled (by defining \fBLSB_MAX_PACK_JOBS\fR in
lsb.conf) to use the -pack option.
.sp 2
In the command line, this option is not compatible with any other
bsub options. Do not put any other bsub options in the command
line, as they must be included in each individual job request in
the file.
.sp 2
In the job submission file, define one job request per line,
using normal bsub syntax but omitting the word "bsub". For
requests in the file, job pack submission supports all bsub
options in the job submission file except for the following:
.sp 2
-I, -Ip, -Is, -IS, -ISp, -ISs, -IX, -XF, -K, -jsdl, -h, -V,
-pack.
.sp 2
When you use the job packs feature to submit multiple jobs to
mbatchd at once, instead of submitting the jobs individually, it
minimizes system overhead and improves the overall job submission
rate dramatically. When you use this feature, you create a job
submission file that defines each job request. You specify all
the bsub options individually for each job, so unlike chunk jobs
and job arrays, there is no need for jobs in this file to have
anything in common. To submit the jobs to LSF, you simply submit
the file using the bsub -pack option.
.sp 2
LSF parses the file contents and submits the job requests to
mbatchd, sending multiple requests at one time. Each group of
jobs submitted to mbatchd together is called a job pack. The job
submission file can contain any number of job requests, and LSF
will group them into job packs automatically. The reason to group
jobs into packs is to maintain proper mbatchd performance: while
mbatchd is processing a job pack, mbatchd is blocked from
processing other requests, so limiting the number of jobs in each
pack ensures a reasonable mbatchd response time for other job
submissions. Job pack size is configurable.
.sp 2
If the cluster configuration is not consistent and mbatchd
receives a job pack that exceeds the job pack size defined in
lsf.conf, it will be rejected.
.sp 2
Once the pack is submitted to mbatchd, each job request in the
pack is handled by LSF as if it was submitted individually with
the bsub command.

   The job submission file is a text file containing all the jobs
   that you want to submit. Each line in the file is one job
   request. For each request, the syntax is identical to the bsub
   command line without the word "bsub".
.sp 2
   For example,
.sp 2
   #This file contains 2 job requests.
.br

.sp 2
   *  Terminal Services jobs are not supported.
.sp 2
   *  I/O redirection is not supported.
.sp 2
   *  Blank lines and comment lines (beginning with #) are
      ignored. Comments at the end of a line are not supported.
.sp 2
   *  Backslash (\) is not considered a special character to join
      two lines.
.sp 2
   *  Shell scripting characters are treated as plain text, they
      will not be interpreted.
.sp 2
   *  Matched pairs of single and double quotations are
      supported, but they must have space before and after. For
      example, -J "job1" is supported, -J"job1" is not, and -J
      "job"1 is not.
.sp 2
   For job dependencies, use the job name instead of job ID to
   specify the dependency condition. A job request will be
   rejected if the job name or job ID of the job it depends on
   does not already exist.
.sp 2

.sp 2

the job to the first queue listed. If that queue cannot be used
because of the job\(aqs resource limits or other restrictions, such
as the requested hosts, your accessibility to a queue, queue
status (closed or open), then the next queue listed is
considered. The order in which the queues are considered is the
same order in which these queues are listed.
.SH Examples

.sp 2

Valid values for priority are any integers between 1 and the

Job owners can change the priority of their own jobs relative to
all other jobs in the queue. LSF administrators and queue

.sp 2
Job order is the first consideration to determine job eligibility
for dispatch. Jobs are still subject to all scheduling policies
regardless of job priority. Jobs are scheduled based first on
their queue priority first, then job priority, and lastly in
first-come first-served order.

User-assigned job priority can be configured with automatic job
priority escalation to automatically increase the priority of

         If you specify a dependency on a job that LSF cannot
         find (such as a job that has not yet been submitted),
         your job submission fails.
.sp 2
         The dependency expression is a logical expression
         composed of one or more dependency conditions. To make
         dependency expression of multiple conditions, use the
         following logical operators:
.sp 2
         && (AND)
.sp 2
         || (OR)
.sp 2
         ! (NOT)
.sp 2
         Use parentheses to indicate the order of operations, if
         necessary.
.sp 2
         Enclose the dependency expression in single quotes (\(aq)
         to prevent the shell from interpreting special
         characters (space, any logic operator, or parentheses).
         If you use single quotes for the dependency expression,
         use double quotes (") for quoted items within it, such
         as job names.
.sp 2
         In a Windows environment with multiple job dependencies,
         use only double quotes.
.sp 2
         In dependency conditions, job names specify only your
         own jobs. By default, if you use the job name to specify
         a dependency condition, and more than one of your jobs
         has the same name, all of your jobs that have that name
         must satisfy the test. If \fBJOB_DEP_LAST_SUB\fR in
         lsb.params is set to 1, the test is done on the job
         submitted most recently.
.sp 2
         Use double quotes (") around job names that begin with a
         number. In the job name, specify the wildcard character
         asterisk (*) at the end of a string, to indicate all
         jobs whose name begins with the string. For example, if
         you use \fRjobA*\fR as the job name, it specifies jobs
         named \fRjobA\fR, \fRjobA1\fR, \fRjobA_test\fR,
         \fRjobA.log\fR, etc.
.sp 2
         Use the * with dependency conditions to define
         one-to-one dependency among job array elements such that
         each element of one array depends on the corresponding
         element of another array. The job array size must be
         identical.
.sp 2
         For example:
.sp 2
         bsub -w "done(myarrayA[*])" -J "myArrayB[1-10]" myJob2 
.br

.sp 2
         indicates that before element 1 of \fRmyArrayB \fRcan
         start, element 1 of \fRmyArrayA \fRmust be completed,
         and so on.
.sp 2
         You can also use the * to establish one-to-one array
         element dependencies with bmod after an array has been
         submitted.
.sp 2
         If you want to specify array dependency by array name,
         set \fBJOB_DEP_LAST_SUB\fR in lsb.params. If you do not
         have this parameter set, the job is rejected if one of
         your previous arrays has the same name but a different
         index.
.sp 2
         In dependency conditions, the variable \fIop\fR
         represents one of the following relational operators:
.sp 2
         >
.sp 2
         >=
.sp 2

         refers to the oldest job of \fIjob_name\fR in memory.

.SH Description

.sp 2
A job warning action must be specified with a job action warning
time in order for job warning to take effect.
.sp 2
If -wa is specified, LSF sends the warning action to the job
before the actual control action is taken. This allows the job
time to save its result before being terminated by the job
control action.
.sp 2
The warning action specified by -wa option overrides
\fBJOB_WARNING_ACTION\fR in the queue. \fBJOB_WARNING_ACTION\fR
is used as the default when no command line option is specified.

\fBbsub -x\fR
.SH Description

.sp 2
In exclusive execution mode, your job runs by itself on a host.
It is dispatched only to a host with no other jobs running, and
LSF does not send any other jobs to the host until the job
completes.
.sp 2
To submit a job in exclusive execution mode, the queue must be
configured to allow exclusive jobs.
.sp 2
When the job is dispatched, bhosts reports the host status as
closed_Excl, and lsload reports the host status as lockU.
.sp 2
Until your job is complete, the host is not selected by LIM in
response to placement requests made by lsplace, lsrun or lsgrun
or any other load sharing applications.
.sp 2
You can force other jobs to run on the host by using the -m
\fIhost_name\fR option of brun(1) to explicitly specify the
locked host.

.sp 2
In the YAML file, specify the bsub option name or alias and the

If you specify duplicate or conflicting job submission

.SH Synopsis

.sp 2
\fBbsub\fR [options] command [arguments]
.SH Description

.sp 2
The job can be specified by a command line argument command, or
through the standard input if the command is not present on the
command line. The\fI command\fR can be anything that is provided
to a UNIX Bourne shell (see sh(1)). command is assumed to begin
with the first word that is not part of a bsub option. All
arguments that follow \fIcommand\fR are provided as the arguments
to the \fIcommand\fR. Use single quotation marks around the
expression if the command or arguments contain special
characters.
.sp 2
The job command can be up to 4094 characters long for UNIX and
Linux or up to 255 characters for Windows. If no job name is
specified with -J, bjobs, bhist and bacct displays the command as
the job name.
.sp 2
If the job is not given on the command line, bsub reads the job
commands from standard input. If the standard input is a
controlling terminal, the user is prompted with \fRbsub>\fR for
the commands of the job. The input is terminated by entering
CTRL-D on a new line. You can submit multiple commands through
standard input.
.sp 2
The commands are executed in the order in which they are given.
bsub options can also be specified in the standard input if the
line begins with \fR#BSUB\fR; for example, \fR#BSUB -x\fR. If an
option is given on both the bsub command line, and in the
standard input, the command line option overrides the option in
the standard input. The user can specify the shell to run the
commands by specifying the shell path name in the first line of
the standard input, such as \fR#!/bin/csh\fR. If the shell is not
given in the first line, the Bourne shell is used. The standard
input facility can be used to spool a user\(aqs job script; such as
\fRbsub < script\fR.
.SH Examples

.sp 2
\fRbsub sleep 100\fR
.sp 2
Submit the UNIX command sleep together with its argument
\fR100\fR as a job.
.sp 2
\fRbsub my_script\fR
.sp 2
Submit \fRmy_script\fR as a job. Since \fRmy_script\fR is
specified as a command line argument, the \fRmy_script\fR file is
not spooled. Later changes to the \fRmy_script\fR file before the
job completes may affect this job.
.sp 2
bsub < default_shell_script
.br

.sp 2
where default_shell_script contains:
.sp 2
sim1.exe
.br
sim2.exe
.sp 2
The file default_shell_script is spooled, and the commands are
run under the Bourne shell since a shell specification is not
given in the first line of the script.
.sp 2
\fRbsub < csh_script\fR
.sp 2
where \fRcsh_script\fR contains:
.sp 2
#!/bin/csh
.br
sim1.exe
.br
sim2.exe
.sp 2
\fRcsh_script\fR is spooled and the commands are run under
/bin/csh.
.sp 2
\fRbsub -q night < my_script\fR
.sp 2
where \fRmy_script\fR contains:
.sp 2
#!/bin/sh
.br
#BSUB -q test
.br
#BSUB -m "host1 host2" # my default candidate hosts
.br
#BSUB -f "input > tmp" -f "output << tmp"
.br
#BSUB -D 200 -c 10/host1
.br
#BSUB -t 13:00
.br
#BSUB -k "dir 5"
.br
sim1.exe
.br
sim2.exe
.sp 2
The job is submitted to the \fRnight\fR queue instead of
\fRtest\fR, because the command line overrides the script.
.sp 2
bsub> sleep 1800
.br
bsub> my_program
.br

.SH Description

.sp 2
The \fBLSB_BSUB_PARSE_SCRIPT\fR parameter must be set to \fRY\fR
in the lsf.conf file to specify a job script.
.sp 2
The job script must be an ASCII text file and not a binary file.
The job script does not have to be an executable file because the
contents of the job script are parsed and run as part of the job.
.sp 2
Use the \fR#BSUB\fR imperative (in upper case letters) at the
beginning of each line to specify job submission options in the
script.
.SH Example

.sp 2

.sp 2
Submits a job for execution and assigns it a unique numerical job
ID.
.sp 2
Runs the job on a host that satisfies all requirements of the
job, when all conditions on the job, host, queue, application
profile, and cluster are satisfied. If LSF cannot run all jobs
immediately, LSF scheduling policies determine the order of
dispatch. Jobs are started and suspended according to the current
system load.
.sp 2
Sets the user\(aqs execution environment for the job, including the
current working directory, file creation mask, and all
environment variables, and sets LSF environment variables before
the job starts.
.sp 2
When a job is run, the command line and stdout/stderr buffers are
stored in the directory home_directory/.lsbatch on the execution
host. If this directory is not accessible, /tmp/.lsbtmp user_ID
is used as the job\(aqs home directory. If the current working
directory is under the home directory on the submission host,
then the current working directory is also set to be the same
relative directory under the home directory on the execution
host.
.sp 2
By default, if the current working directory is not accessible on
the execution host, LSF finds a working direction to run the job
in the following order:
.sp 2
1. \fI$PWD\fR
.sp 2
2. Strip /tmp_mnt if it is exists in the path
.sp 2
3. Replace the first component with a key in /etc/auto.master and
   try each key
.sp 2
4. Replace the first 2 components with a key in /etc/auto.master
   and try for each key
.sp 2
5. Strip the first level of the path and try the rest (for
   example, if the current working directory is /abc/x/y/z, try
   to change directory to the path /x/y/z)
.sp 2
6. /tmp
.sp 2
If the environment variable \fBLSB_EXIT_IF_CWD_NOTEXIST\fR is set
to Y and the current working directory is not accessible on the
execution host, the job exits with the exit code 2.
.sp 2
If no command is supplied, bsub prompts for the command from the
standard input. On UNIX, the input is terminated by entering
CTRL-D on a new line. On Windows, the input is terminated by
entering CTRL-Z on a new line.
.sp 2
To kill a job that is submitted with bsub, use bkill.
.sp 2
Use bmod to modify jobs that are submitted with bsub. bmod takes
similar options to bsub.
.sp 2
Jobs that are submitted to a chunk job queue with the following
options are not chunked; they are dispatched individually:
.sp 2
*  -I (interactive jobs)
.sp 2
*  -c (jobs with CPU limit greater than 30)
.sp 2
*  -W (jobs with run limit greater than 30 minutes)
.sp 2
To submit jobs from UNIX to display GUIs through Microsoft
Terminal Services on Windows, submit the job with bsub and define
the environment variables \fBLSF_LOGON_DESKTOP=1\fR and
\fBLSB_TSJOB=1\fR on the UNIX host. Use tssub to submit a
Terminal Services job from Windows hosts. See Using LSF on
Windows for more details.
.sp 2
If the parameter \fBLSB_STDOUT_DIRECT\fR in lsf.conf is set to Y
or y, and you use the -o or -oo option, the standard output of a
job is written to the file you specify as the job runs. If
\fBLSB_STDOUT_DIRECT\fR is not set, and you use -o or -oo, the
standard output of a job is written to a temporary file and
copied to the specified file after the job finishes.
\fBLSB_STDOUT_DIRECT\fR is not supported on Windows.
.SH Default behavior

.sp 2
LSF assumes that uniform user names and user ID spaces exist
among all the hosts in the cluster. That is jobs run under on the
execution host the same users account as the job was submitted
with. For situations where nonuniform user names and user ID
spaces exist, account mapping must be used to determine the
account that is used to run a job.
.sp 2
bsub uses the command name as the job name. Quotation marks are
significant.
.sp 2
Options that are related to file names and job spooling
directories support paths that contain up to 4094 characters for
UNIX and Linux, or up to 255 characters for Windows.
.sp 2
Options that are related to command names and job names can
contain up to 4094 characters for UNIX and Linux, or up to 255
characters for Windows.
.sp 2
Options for the following resource usage limits are specified in
KB:
.sp 2
*  Core limit (-C)
.sp 2
*  Memory limit (-M)
.sp 2
*  Stack limit (-S)
.sp 2
*  Swap limit (-v)
.sp 2
Use \fBLSF_UNIT_FOR_LIMITS\fR in lsf.conf to specify a larger
unit for the limit (MB, GB, TB, PB, or EB).
.sp 2
If fairshare is defined and you belong to multiple user groups,
the job is scheduled under the user group that allows the
quickest dispatch.
.sp 2
The job is not checkpointable.
.sp 2
bsub automatically selects an appropriate queue. If you defined a
default queue list by setting \fBLSB_DEFAULTQUEUE\fR environment
variable, the queue is selected from your list. If
\fBLSB_DEFAULTQUEUE\fR is not defined, the queue is selected from
the system default queue list that is specified by the LSF
administrator with the \fBDEFAULT_QUEUE\fR parameter in
lsb.params.
.sp 2
LSF tries to obtain resource requirement information for the job
from the remote task list that is maintained by the load sharing
library. If the job is not listed in the remote task list, the
default resource requirement is to run the job on a host or hosts
that are of the same host type as the submission host.
.sp 2
bsub assumes that only one processor is requested.
.sp 2
bsub does not start a login shell but runs the job file under the
execution environment from which the job was submitted.
.sp 2
The input file for the job is /dev/null (no input).
.sp 2
bsub sends mail to you when the job is done. The default
destination is defined by \fBLSB_MAILTO\fR in lsf.conf. The mail
message includes the job report, the job output (if any), and the
error message (if any).
.sp 2
bsub charges the job to the default project. The default project
is the project that you define by setting the environment
variable \fBLSB_DEFAULTPROJECT\fR. If you do not set
\fBLSB_DEFAULTPROJECT\fR, the default project is the project that
is specified by the LSF administrator with \fBDEFAULT_PROJECT\fR
parameter in lsb.params. If \fBDEFAULT_PROJECT\fR is not defined,
then LSF uses default as the default project name.
.SH Output

.sp 2
If the job is successfully submitted, bsub displays the job ID
and the queue that the job was submitted to.
.SH Limitations

.sp 2
When account mapping is used, the command bpeek does not work.
File transfer with the -f option to bsub requires rcp to be
working between the submission and execution hosts. Use the -N
option to request mail, or the -o and -e options to specify an
output file and error file.
.SH Submitting jobs with SSH

.sp 2
Secure Shell (SSH) is a network protocol that provides
confidentiality and integrity of data using a secure channel
between two networked devices.
.sp 2
SSH uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote
computer and allow the remote computer to authenticate the user,
if necessary.
.sp 2
SSH is typically used to log into a remote machine and execute
commands, but it also supports tunneling, forwarding arbitrary
TCP ports and X11 connections. SSH uses a client-server protocol.
.sp 2
SSH uses private/public key pairs to log into another host. Users
no longer have to supply a password every time they log on to a
remote host.
.sp 2
SSH is used when running any of the following jobs:
.sp 2
*  An interactive job (bsub -IS | -ISp | ISs)
.sp 2
*  An interactive X-window job with X11 forwarding (bsub -XF)
.sp 2
*  An interactive X-window job, without X11 forwarding (bsub -IX)
.sp 2
*  An externally submitted job (esub)
.sp 2
SSH only supports UNIX for submission and execution hosts. The
display host can be any operating system.
.sp 2
Depending on your requirements for X-Window jobs, you can choose
either bsub -XF (recommended) or bsub -IX. Both options encrypt
the X-Server and X-Clients.
.sp 2
SSH X11 forwarding (bsub -XF) has the following benefits:
.sp 2
*  Any password required can be typed in when needed.
.sp 2
*  Does not require the X-Server host to have the SSH daemon
   installed.
.sp 2
SSH X11 forwarding has the following drawbacks:
.sp 2
*  The user must enable X11 forwarding in the client.
.sp 2
*  Submission and execution hosts must be UNIX hosts.
.sp 2
SSH X11 forwarding has the following dependencies:
.sp 2
*  OpenSSH 3.9p1 and up is supported.
.sp 2
   OpenSSL 0.9.7a and up is supported.
.sp 2
*  You must have SSH correctly installed on all hosts in the
   cluster.
.sp 2
*  You must use an SSH client to log on to the submission host
   from the display host.
.sp 2
*  You must install and run the X-Server program on the display
   host.
.sp 2
SSH X11 forwarding has the following limitations:
.sp 2
*  You cannot run with bsub -K, -IX, or -r.
.sp 2
*  You cannot bmod a job submitted with X11 forwarding.
.sp 2
*  Cannot be used with job arrays, job chunks, or user account
   mapping.
.sp 2
*  Jobs submitted with X11 forwarding cannot be checked or
   modified by esubs.
.sp 2
