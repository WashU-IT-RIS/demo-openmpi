.SH Description

.sp 2
By default, returns the following information about all hosts:
Host name, host status, job state statistics, and job slot
limits.
.sp 2
The bhosts command displays output for condensed host groups and
compute units. These host groups and compute units are defined by
\fRCONDENSE\fR in the \fRHostGroup\fR and \fRComputeUnit\fR
sections of the lsb.hosts file. Condensed host groups and compute
units are displayed as a single entry with the name as defined by
\fRGROUP_NAME\fR or \fRNAME\fR in the lsb.hosts file.
.sp 2
When EGO adds more resources to a running resizable job, the
bhosts command displays the added resources. When EGO removes
resources from a running resizable job, the bhosts command
displays the updated resources.
.sp 2
The -l and -X options display uncondensed output.
.sp 2
The -s option displays information about the numeric shared
resources and their associated hosts.
.sp 2
With LSF multicluster capability, displays the information about
hosts available to the local cluster. Use the -e option to see
information about exported hosts.
.SH Options

.sp 2
\fB-a\fR
.br
         Shows information about all hosts, including hosts
         relinquished to a resource provider (such as EGO or
         OpenStack) through LSF resource connector. Default
         output includes only standard LSF hosts.
.sp 2
\fB-aff\fR
.br
         Displays host topology information for CPU and memory
         affinity scheduling.
.sp 2
\fB-alloc\fR
.br
         Shows counters for slots in \fRRUN\fR, \fRSSUSP\fR,
         \fRUSUSP\fR, and \fRRSV\fR. The slot allocation is
         different depending on whether the job is an exclusive
         job or not.
.sp 2
\fB-attr\fR
.br
         Displays information on attributes that are attached to
         the host. These attributes were created with the battr
         create command, or automatically created according to
         attribute requests.
.sp 2
\fB-cname\fR
.br
         In LSF Advanced Edition, includes the cluster name for
         execution cluster hosts in output. The output that is
         displayed is sorted by cluster and then by host name.
.sp 2
         \fBNote: \fRThis command option is deprecated and might
         be removed in a future version of LSF.
.sp 2
\fB-e\fR
.br
         LSF multicluster capability only. Displays information
         about resources that were exported to another cluster.
.sp 2
\fB-gpu [-l]\fR
.br
         Displays GPU information on the host.
.sp 2
         The -l option shows more detailed information about the
         GPUs.
.sp 2
\fB-json\fR
.br
         Displays the customized output in JSON format.
.sp 2
         When specified, bhosts -o displays the customized output
         in the JSON format.
.sp 2
         This option applies only to output for the bhosts -o
         command for customized output. This option has no effect
         when used with bhosts without the -o option and the
         \fBLSB_BHOSTS_FORMAT\fR environment variable and
         parameter are not defined.
.sp 2
\fB-l\fR
.br
         Displays host information in a long multi-line format.
         In adslotsdition to the default fields, displays
         information about the CPU factor, the current load, and
         the load thresholds. Also displays the value of \fR\fR
         for each host. The \fRslots\fR value is the greatest
         number of unused slots on a host.
.sp 2
         The bhosts -l option also displays information about the
         dispatch windows.
.sp 2
         When PowerPolicy is enabled in the lsb.threshold file,
         the bhosts -l command also displays host power states.
         Final power states are \fRon\fR or \fRsuspend\fR.
         Intermediate power states are \fRrestarting\fR,
         \fRresuming\fR, and \fRsuspending\fR. The final power
         state under administrator control is \fRclosed_Power\fR.
         The final power state under policy control is
         \fRok_Power\fR. If the host status becomes unknown
         (power operation due to failure), the power state is
         shown as a dash (\fR-\fR).
.sp 2
         If you specified an administrator comment with the -C
         option of the host control commands (badmin hclose -C or
         badmin hopen -C), the -l option displays the comment
         text. If there are any lock IDs that are attached to a
         closed host, these lock IDs are displayed with any
         attached comments in a tabular format.
.sp 2
         If enhanced energy accounting using Elasticsearch has
         been enabled (with \fBLSF_ENABLE_BEAT_SERVICE\fR in
         lsf.conf), output will show the \fBCurrent Power\fR
         usage in watts, and total \fBEnergy Consumed\fR in Joule
         and kWh.
.sp 2
         If attributes are attached to the host, the -l option
         shows detailed information on these attributes.
.sp 2
\fB-noheader\fR
.br
         Removes the column headings from the output.
.sp 2
         When specified, bhosts displays the values of the fields
         without displaying the names of the fields. This option
         is useful for script parsing, when column headings are
         not necessary.
.sp 2
         This option applies to output for the bhosts command
         with no options, and to output for all bhosts options
         with output that uses column headings, including the
         following options: -a, -alloc, -cname, -e, -o, -R, -s,
         -w, -x, -X.
.sp 2
         This option does not apply to output for bhosts options
         that do not use column headings, including the following
         options: -aff, -json, -l.
.sp 2
\fB-o\fR
.br
         Sets the customized output format.
.sp 2
         *  Specify which bhosts fields (or aliases instead of
            the full field names), in which order, and with what
            width to display.
.sp 2
         *  Specify only the bhosts field name or alias to set
            its output to unlimited width and left justification.
.sp 2
         *  Specify the colon (\fR:\fR) without a width to set
            the output width to the recommended width for that
            field.
.sp 2
         *  Specify the colon (\fR:\fR) with a width to set the
            maximum number of characters to display for the
            field. When its value exceeds this width, bhosts
            truncates the ending characters.
.sp 2
         *  Specify a hyphen (\fR-\fR) to set right justification
            when bhosts displays the output for the specific
            field. If not specified, the default is to set left
            justification when bhosts displays the output for a
            field.
.sp 2
         *  Use \fRdelimiter=\fR to set the delimiting character
            to display between different headers and fields. This
            delimiter must be a single character. By default, the
            delimiter is a space.
.sp 2
         Output customization applies only to the output for
         certain bhosts options:
.sp 2
         *  \fBLSB_BHOSTS_FORMAT\fR and bhosts -o both apply to
            output for the bhosts command with no options, and
            for bhosts options with output that filter
            information, including the following options: -a,
            -alloc, -cname, -R, -x, -X.
.sp 2
         *  \fBLSB_BHOSTS_FORMAT\fR and bhosts -o do not apply to
            output for bhosts options that use a modified format,
            including the following options: -aff, -e, -l, -s,
            -w.
.sp 2
         The bhosts -o option overrides the
         \fBLSB_BHOSTS_FORMAT\fR environment variable, which
         overrides the \fBLSB_BHOSTS_FORMAT\fR setting in
         lsf.conf.
.sp 2
         The following are the field names used to specify the
         bhosts fields to display, recommended width, aliases you
         can use instead of field names, and units of measurement
         for the displayed field:

         Field names and aliases are not case-sensitive. Valid
         values for the output width are any positive integer 1 -

         delimiter=\(aq^\(aq"\fR
.sp 2
         This command displays the following fields:
.sp 2
         *  HOST_NAME with unlimited width and left justified.
.sp 2
         *  CPUF with a maximum width of ten characters (which is
            the recommended width) and left justified.
.sp 2
         *  JL_U with a maximum width of eight characters (which
            is the recommended width) and right justified.
.sp 2
         *  MAX with a maximum width of six characters and right
            justified.
.sp 2
         *  The \fR^\fR character is displayed between different
            headers and fields.
.sp 2
\fB-w\fR
.br
         Displays host information in wide format. Fields are
         displayed without truncation.
.sp 2
         For condensed host groups and compute units, the -w
         option displays the overall status and the number of
         hosts with the \fRok\fR, \fRunavail\fR, \fRunreach\fR,
         and \fRbusy\fR status in the following format:
.sp 2
         \fR\fIhost_group_status\fR
         \fInum_ok\fR/\fInum_unavail\fR/\fInum_unreach\fR/\fInum_busy\fR\fR
.sp 2
         Where
.sp 2
         *  \fIhost_group_status\fR is the overall status of the
            host group or compute unit. If a single host in the
            group or unit is \fRok\fR, the overall status is also
            \fRok\fR.
.sp 2
         *  \fInum_ok\fR, \fInum_unavail\fR, \fInum_unreach\fR,
            and \fInum_busy\fR are the number of hosts that are
            \fRok\fR, \fRunavail\fR, \fRunreach\fR, and
            \fRbusy\fR.
.sp 2
         For example, if five hosts are \fRok\fR, two
         \fRunavail\fR, one \fRunreach\fR, and three \fRbusy\fR
         in a condensed host group \fRhg1\fR, the following
         status is displayed:
.sp 2
         hg1 ok 5/2/1/3
.br

.sp 2
         If any hosts in the host group or compute unit are
         closed, the status for the host group is displayed as
         \fRclosed\fR, with no status for the other states:
.sp 2
         hg1 closed
.br

.sp 2
         The status of LSF resource connector hosts that are
         closed because of a resource provider reclaim request is
         \fRclosed_RC\fR.
.sp 2
\fB-rc [-l]\fR
.br
         Displays the current status of hosts requested from and
         provisioned by LSF resource connector, as well as a
         brief history of each provisioned host.
.sp 2
         \fBNote: \fRRequires LSF Fix Pack 4.
.sp 2
         The -rc and -rconly options make use of the third-party
         mosquitto message queue application. LSF resource
         connector publishes additional provider host information
         that is displayed by these bhosts options. The mosquitto
         binary file is included as part of the LSF distribution.
.sp 2
         To use the -rc option, LSF resource connector must be
         enabled with the \fBLSB_RC_EXTERNAL_HOST_FLAG\fR
         parameter in the lsf.conf file.
.sp 2
         If you use the MQTT message broker that is distributed
         withLSF, you must configure the
         \fBLSF_MQ_BROKER_HOSTS\fR and \fBMQTT_BROKER_HOST\fR
         parameters in the lsf.conf file. The
         \fBLSF_MQ_BROKER_HOSTS\fR and \fBMQTT_BROKER_HOST\fR
         parameters must specify the same host name. The
         \fBLSF_MQ_BROKER_HOSTS\fR parameter enables LIM to start
         the mosquitto daemon.
.sp 2
         If you use an existing MQTT message broker, you must
         configure the \fBMQTT_BROKER_HOST\fR parameter. You can
         optionally specify an MQTT broker port with the
         \fBMQTT_BROKER_PORT\fR parameter.
.sp 2
         Use the ps command to check that the MQTT message broker
         daemon (mosquitto) is installed and running: \fRps -ef |
         grep mosquitto\fR.
.sp 2
         Configure the \fBEBROKERD_HOST_CLEAN_DELAY\fR to specify
         a delay, in minutes, after which the ebrokerd daemon
         removes information about relinquished or reclaimed
         hosts. This parameter allows the bhosts -rc and bhosts
         -rconly commands to get LSF resource connector provider
         host information for some time after they are
         deprovisioned.
.sp 2
         The following additional columns are shown in the host

.sp 2
         \fBNote: \fRRequires LSF Fix Pack 4.
.sp 2
         To use the -rconly option, LSF resource connector must
         be enabled with the \fBLSB_RC_EXTERNAL_HOST_FLAG\fR
         parameter in the lsf.conf file. If you use the MQTT
         message broker that is distributed withLSF, you must
         configure the \fBLSF_MQ_BROKER_HOSTS\fR and
         \fBMQTT_BROKER_HOST\fR parameters in the lsf.conf file.
         The \fBLSF_MQ_BROKER_HOSTS\fR and \fBMQTT_BROKER_HOST\fR
         parameters must specify the same host name. The
         \fBLSF_MQ_BROKER_HOSTS\fR parameter enables LIM to start
         the mosquitto daemon.
.sp 2
         If you use an existing MQTT message broker, you must
         configure the \fBMQTT_BROKER_HOST\fR parameter. You can
         optionally specify an MQTT broker port with the
         \fBMQTT_BROKER_PORT\fR parameter.
.sp 2
         Use the ps command to check that the MQTT message broker
         daemon (mosquitto) is installed and running: \fRps -ef |

         default, these hosts are closed the next time LSF checks
         host exceptions and runs eadmin.
.sp 2
         Use with the -l option to show detailed information
         about host exceptions.
.sp 2
         If no hosts exceed the job exit rate, the bhosts -x

         no limit.
.sp 2
         For condensed host groups or compute units, the
         \fRJL/U\fR value is the total number of job slots that
         all hosts in the group or unit can process on a per user
         basis.
.sp 2
         The host does not allocate more than \fRJL/U\fR job
         slots for one user at the same time. These job slots are
         used by running jobs, as well as by suspended or pending
         jobs with reserved slots.
.sp 2
         For preemptive scheduling, the accounting is different.

.sp 2
\fBMAX\fR
.br
         The maximum number of job slots available. A dash
         (\fR-\fR) indicates no limit.
.sp 2
         For condensed host groups and compute units, the
         \fRMAX\fR value is the total maximum number of job slots
         available in all hosts in the host group or compute
         unit.
.sp 2
         These job slots are used by running jobs, as well as by
         suspended or pending jobs with reserved slots.
.sp 2
         If preemptive scheduling is used, suspended jobs are not
         counted.
.sp 2
         A host does not always have to allocate this many job
         slots if jobs are waiting. The host must also satisfy
         its configured load conditions to accept more jobs.
.sp 2
\fBNJOBS \fR
.br
         The number of tasks for all jobs that are dispatched to

.sp 2
         For condensed host groups and compute units, the
         \fRNJOBS\fR value is the total number of tasks that are
         used by jobs that are dispatched to any host in the host
         group or compute unit.
.sp 2
         If the -alloc option is used, total is the sum of the

         The number of tasks for all running jobs on the host.
.sp 2
         For condensed host groups and compute units, the
         \fRRUN\fR value is the total number of tasks for running
         jobs on any host in the host group or compute unit. If
         the -alloc option is used, total is the allocated slots
         for the jobs on the host.
.sp 2
\fBSSUSP\fR
.br
         The number of tasks for all system suspended jobs on the
         host.
.sp 2
         For condensed host groups and compute units, the
         \fRSSUSP\fR value is the total number of tasks for all
         system suspended jobs on any host in the host group or
         compute unit. If the -alloc option used, total is the
         allocated slots for the jobs on the host.
.sp 2
\fBUSUSP\fR
.br
         The number of tasks for all user suspended jobs on the
         host. Jobs can be suspended by the user or by the LSF
         administrator.
.sp 2
         For condensed host groups and compute units, the
         \fRUSUSP\fR value is the total number of tasks for all
         user suspended jobs on any host in the host group or
         compute unit. If the -alloc option used, total is the
         allocated slots for the jobs on the host.

.sp 2
         For condensed host groups and compute units, the
         \fRRSV\fR value is the total number of tasks for all
         pending jobs with reserved slots on any host in the host
         group or compute unit. If the -alloc option used, total
         is the allocated slots for the jobs on the host.
.SH Output: Host-based -l option

.sp 2
In addition to the default output fields, the -l option also
displays the following information:
.sp 2
\fBloadSched, loadStop\fR
.br
         The scheduling and suspending thresholds for the host.
         If a threshold is not defined, the threshold from the
         queue definition applies. If both the host and the queue
         define a threshold for a load index, the most
         restrictive threshold is used.
.sp 2
         The migration threshold is the time that a job
         dispatched to this host can remain suspended by the
         system before LSF attempts to migrate the job to another
         host.
.sp 2
\fBSTATUS\fR
.br
         The long format that is shown by the -l option gives the

.sp 2
\fBDISPATCH_WINDOW\fR
.br
         Displays the dispatch windows for each host. Dispatch
         windows are the time windows during the week when batch
         jobs can be run on each host. Jobs that are already
         started are not affected by the dispatch windows. When
         the dispatch windows close, jobs are not suspended. Jobs
         already running continue to run, but no new jobs are
         started until the windows reopen. The default for the
         dispatch window is no restriction or always open (that
         is, twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week). For
         the dispatch window specification, see the description
         for the \fRDISPATCH_WINDOWS\fR keyword under the
         \fR-l\fR option in the \fRbqueues\fR command.
.sp 2
\fBCURRENT LOAD\fR
.br
         Displays the total and reserved host load.
.sp 2
         \fBReserved\fR
.br
                  You specify reserved resources by using the
                  bsub -R option. These resources are reserved by
                  jobs that are running on the host.
.sp 2
         \fBTotal\fR
.br
                  The total load has different meanings,
                  depending on whether the load index is
                  increasing or decreasing.
.sp 2
                  For increasing load indices, such as run queue
                  lengths, CPU usage, paging activity, logins,
                  and disk I/O, the total load is the consumed
                  plus the reserved amount. The total load is
                  calculated as the sum of the current load and
                  the reserved load. The current load is the load
                  that is shown by the lsload command.
.sp 2
                  For decreasing load indices, such as available
                  memory, idle time, available swap space, and
                  available space in tmp, the total load is the
                  available amount. The total load is the
                  difference between the current load and the
                  reserved load. This difference is the available
                  resource as shown by the lsload command.
.sp 2
\fBLOAD THRESHOLD\fR
.br
         Displays the scheduling threshold (\fRloadSched\fR) and
         the suspending threshold (\fRloadStop\fR). Also displays
         the migration threshold if defined and the checkpoint
         support if the host supports checkpointing.
.sp 2
         The format for the thresholds is the same as for batch
         job queues. For an explanation of the thresholds and
         load indices, see the description for the \fRQUEUE
         SCHEDULING PARAMETERS\fR keyword under the -l option of
         the bqueues command.
.sp 2
\fBTHRESHOLD AND LOAD USED FOR EXCEPTIONS\fR

.sp 2
         A socket is a collection of cores with a direct pipe to
         memory. Each socket contains 1 or more cores. A socket
         is not necessarily a physical socket, but rather refers
         to the memory architecture of the machine.
.sp 2
         A core is a single entity capable of performing
         computations.
.sp 2
         A node contains sockets. A socket contains cores, and a
         core can contain threads if the core is enabled for
         multithreading.
.sp 2
         If no NUMA nodes are present, then the NUMA layer in the
