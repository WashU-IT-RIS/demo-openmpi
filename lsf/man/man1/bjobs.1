.SH Description

.sp 2
When specified, bjobs displays any times (but not time stamps) in
the customized output in \fIhh:mm:ss\fR format.
.sp 2
The \fRcpu_used\fR field normally uses one decimal place in the
bjobs output, but if you specify -hms, bjobs rounds up this field
to the next second. For example, if the \fRcpu_used\fR field is
0.2 seconds, specifying -hms rounds this number up to
\fR00:00:01\fR.
.sp 2
For the \fRruntimelimit\fR field, if the \fBABS_RUNLIMIT\fR
parameter is defined as \fRY\fR in the lsb.params file and you
specify -hms, bjobs does not display the host name. That is, if
\fRABS_RUNLIMIT=Y\fR is defined in the lsb.params file, bjobs
normally displays the host name after the runtime limit (for
example, \fR3.0/hostA\fR). If you specify -hms, bjobs displays
the runtime limit without the host name (for example,
\fR00:03:00\fR). This also applies if the \fBABS_RUNLIMIT\fR
parameter is defined as \fRY\fR in the lsb.applications file and
you specify -hms to a job that is submitted to an application
profile with \fRABS_RUNLIMIT=Y\fR.
.sp 2
Specifying the -hms option overrides the
\fBLSB_HMS_TIME_FORMAT\fR environment variable, which overrides
the \fBLSB_HMS_TIME_FORMAT\fR parameter setting in the lsf.conf
file.
.sp 2
This option applies only to output for the bjobs -o and bjobs -o

when run with bjobs without the -o option.

If the \fBJOB_IDLE\fR parameter is configured in the queue, use
bjobs -l to display job idle exception information.
.sp 2
If you submitted your job with the -U option to use advance
reservations that are created with the brsvadd command, bjobs -l
shows the reservation ID used by the job.
.sp 2
If the \fBLSF_HPC_EXTENSIONS="SHORT_PIDLIST"\fR parameter is
specified in the lsf.conf file, the output from bjobs is
shortened to display only the first PID and a count of the
process group IDs (PGIDs) and process IDs for the job. Without
\fBSHORT_PIDLIST\fR, all of the process IDs (PIDs) for a job are
displayed.
.sp 2
If the \fBLSF_HPC_EXTENSIONS="HOST_RUSAGE"\fR parameter is
specified in the lsf.conf file, the output from the bjobs -l
command reports the correct rusage-based usage and the total
rusage that is being charged to the execution host.
.sp 2
If you submitted a job with multiple resource requirement strings
by using the bsub -R option for the order, same, rusage, and
select sections, bjobs -l displays a single, merged resource
requirement string for those sections, as if they were submitted
by using a single -R option.
.sp 2
If you submitted a job by using the OR (||) expression to specify
alternative resources, this option displays the Execution rusage

.sp 2
Predicted start time for \fRPEND\fR reserve job is not shown with
the bjobs -l command option. LSF does not calculate the predicted

was submitted in SSH X11 forwarding mode as well as the SSH
command submitted (set in \fBLSB_SSH_XFORWARD_CMD\fR in
lsf.conf).
.sp 2
If the job was auto-attached to a guarantee SLA, -l displays the
auto-attached SLA name.
.sp 2
Specified CWD shows the value of the bsub -cwd option or the
value of \fBLSB_JOB_CWD\fR. The CWD path with pattern values is
displayed. CWD is the submission directory where bsub ran. If
specified CWD was not defined, this field is not shown. The
execution CWD with pattern values is always shown.
.sp 2
If the job was submitted with an energy policy, to automatically
select a CPU frequency, -l shows the Combined CPU frequency (the
CPU frequency that is selected for the job based on the energy
policy tag, energy policy, and threshold file). If the job was
submitted with a user-defined CPU frequency (by using bsub
-freq), -l shows the Specified CPU frequency for the job.
.sp 2
For jobs submitted with the default GPU requirements (with the
option -gpu -), use the bjobs -l command to see the default
job-level resource requirement without details like
\fR<num=1...>: Requested GPU\fR.
.sp 2
If the -gpu option specifies GPU requirements (for example,
\fR-gpu num=3\fR, the bjobs -l shows the details as \fRRequested
GPU <num=3>\fR.
.sp 2
The bjobs -l command displays an output section for GPU jobs that
shows the combined and effective GPU requirements that are
specified for the job. The GPU requirement string is in the
format of the \fBGPU_REQ\fR parameter in the application profile
or queue:
.sp 2
*  The combined GPU requirement is merged based on the current
   GPU requirements in job, queue, application, or default GPU
   requirement.
.sp 2
*  The effective GPU requirement is the one used by a started
   job. It never changes after a job is started.
.sp 2
Jobs that are submitted with an esub (or epsub) by using bsub -a
(or modified by using bmod -a), shows the latest esubs used for
execution in bjobs -l output, first with the default and then
user esubs. If a user-specified esub script is the same as the
default esub script, the duplicate esubs shows as one entry. If a
job is submitted with an esub containing parameters, the esub and
its parameters are shown in bjobs -l as well, and the format of
the esub is the same as the esub that is specified in the job
submission. For example:
.sp 2
bsub -a "test(a,b,c) " sleep 10000
.sp 2
is shown as:
.sp 2
Job <1561>, User <joes>, Project <default>, Status <RUN>, Queue <normal>,

.SH Description

.sp 2
To see the available hosts, use bhosts.
.sp 2
If a host group or compute unit is specified, displays jobs
dispatched to all hosts in the group. To determine the available
host groups, use bmgroup. To determine the available compute
units, use bmgroup -cu.
.sp 2
With LSF multicluster capability, displays jobs in the specified
cluster. If a remote cluster name is specified, you see the
remote job ID, even if the execution host belongs to the local
cluster. To determine the available clusters, use bclusters.
.SH Examples

.sp 2
\fRbjobs -d -q short -m hostA -u user1\fR
.sp 2
Displays all the recently finished jobs submitted by \fRuser1\fR
to the queue \fRshort\fR, and executed on the host \fRhostA\fR.

\fBbjobs -noheader\fR
.SH Description

.sp 2
When specified, bjobs displays the values of the fields without
displaying the names of the fields. This is useful for script
parsing, when column headings are not necessary.
.sp 2
This option applies to output for the bjobs command with no
options, and to output for all bjobs options with short form
output except for -aff, -l, -UF, -N, -h, and -V.

.SH Description

.sp 2
*  Specify which bjobs fields (or aliases instead of the full
   field names), in which order, and with what width to display.
.sp 2
*  Specify only the bjobs field name or alias to set its output
   to unlimited width and left justification.
.sp 2
*  Specify the colon (\fR:\fR) without an output width to set the
   output width to the recommended width for that field.
.sp 2
*  Specify the colon (\fR:\fR) with an output width to set the
   maximum number of characters to display for the field. When
   its value exceeds this width, bjobs truncates the output:
.sp 2
   *  For the JOB_NAME field, bjobs removes the header characters
      and replaces them with an asterisk (\fR*\fR)
.sp 2
   *  For other fields, bjobs truncates the ending characters
.sp 2
*  Specify a hyphen (\fR-\fR) to set right justification when
   bjobs displays the output for the specific field. If not
   specified, the default is to set left justification when bjobs
   displays the output for a field.
.sp 2
*  Specify a second colon (\fR:\fR) with a unit to specify a unit
   prefix for the output for the following fields: \fRmem\fR,
   \fRmax_mem\fR, \fRavg_mem\fR, \fRmemlimit\fR, \fRswap\fR,
   \fRswaplimit\fR, \fRcorelimit\fR, \fRstacklimit\fR, and
   \fRhrusage\fR (for \fRhrusage\fR, the unit prefix is for
   \fRmem\fR and \fRswap\fR resources only).
.sp 2
   This unit is \fRKB\fR (or \fRK\fR) for kilobytes, \fRMB\fR (or
   \fRM\fR) for megabytes, \fRGB\fR (or \fRG\fR) for gigabytes,
   \fRTB\fR (or \fRT\fR) for terabytes, \fRPB\fR (or \fRP\fR) for
   petabytes, \fREB\fR (or \fRE\fR) for exabytes, \fRZB\fR (or
   \fRZ\fR) for zettabytes), or \fRS\fR to automatically adjust
   the value to a suitable unit prefix and remove the "bytes"
   suffix from the unit. The default is to automatically adjust
   the value to a suitable unit prefix, but keep the "bytes"
   suffix in the unit.
.sp 2
   The display value keeps two decimals but rounds up the third
   decimal. For example, if the unit prefix is set to \fRG\fR,
   \fR10M\fR displays as \fR0.01G\fR.
.sp 2
   The unit prefix specified here overrides the value of the
   \fBLSB_UNIT_FOR_JOBS_DISPLAY\fR environment variable, which
   also overrides the value of the
   \fBLSB_UNIT_FOR_JOBS_DISPLAY\fR parameter in the lsf.conf
   file.
.sp 2
*  Use \fRdelimiter=\fR to set the delimiting character to
   display between different headers and fields. This delimiter
   must be a single character. By default, the delimiter is a
   space.
.sp 2
To specify special delimiter characters in a csh environment (for
example, \fR$\fR), use double quotation marks (\fR"\fR) in the
delimiter specification and single quotation marks (\fR\(aq\fR) in
the -o statement:
.sp 2
\fRbjobs \fR...\fR -o
\(aq\fIfield_name\fR\fR[\fR:\fR[\fR-\fR][\fR\fIoutput_width\fR\fR]]
 ... [\fRdelimiter="\fIcharacter\fR"\fR]\fR\(aq\fR
.sp 2
The -o option applies only to output for certain bjobs options:
.sp 2
*  This option applies to output for the bjobs command with no
   options, and for bjobs options with short form output that
   filter information, including the following options: -a, -app,
   -d, -g, -G, -J, -Jd, -Lp, -m, -P, -q, -r, -sla, -u, -x, -X.
.sp 2
*  This option applies to output for bjobs options that use a
   modified format and filter information, including the
   following options: -fwd, -N, -p, -s.
.sp 2
*  This option does not apply to output for bjobs options that
   use a modified format, including the following options: -A,
   -aff, -aps, -l, -UF, -ss, -sum, -UF, -w, -W, -WF, -WL, -WP.
.sp 2
The bjobs -o option overrides the \fBLSB_BJOBS_FORMAT\fR
environment variable, which overrides the \fBLSB_BJOBS_FORMAT\fR
setting in lsf.conf.
.sp 2
The following are the field names used to specify the bjobs
fields to display, recommended width, aliases you can use instead
of field names, and units of measurement for the displayed field:

Field names and aliases are not case-sensitive. Valid values for
the output width are any positive integer 1 - 4096. If the jobid
field is defined with no output width and
\fBLSB_JOBID_DISP_LENGTH\fR is defined in lsf.conf, the
\fBLSB_JOBID_DISP_LENGTH\fR value is used for the output width.
If jobid is defined with a specified output width, the specified
output width overrides the \fBLSB_JOBID_DISP_LENGTH\fR value.
.SH Example

.sp 2
\fRbjobs -o "jobid stat: queue:- project:10 application:-6

.sp 2
This command (used to illustrate the different subcommands for
-o) displays the following fields for a job with the job ID 123:
.sp 2
*  JOBID with unlimited width and left-aligned. If
   LSB_JOBID_DISP_LENGTH is specified, that value is used for the
   output width instead.
.sp 2
*  STAT with a maximum width of 5 characters (which is the
   recommended width) and left-aligned.
.sp 2
*  QUEUE with a maximum width of 10 characters (which is the
   recommended width) and right-aligned.
.sp 2
*  PROJECT with a maximum width of 10 characters and
   left-aligned.
.sp 2
*  APPLICATION with a maximum width of 6 characters and
   right-aligned.
.sp 2
*  MEM with a maximum width of 12 characters, a unit prefix of G
   (for gigabytes), and left-aligned.
.sp 2
*  The \fR^\fR character is displayed between different headers
   and fields.

\fBbjobs -p\fR<level0-3>
.SH Description

.sp 2
Displays the pending reason or reasons and the number of hosts
giving that reason.
.sp 2
*  0: Displays bjobs -p output as before the LSF 10.1 release.
.sp 2
*  1: Displays the single key pending reason.
.sp 2
*  2: Displays categorized host-based pending reasons for
   candidate hosts in the cluster. For the candidate hosts, the
   actual reason on each host is shown. For each pending reason,
   the number of hosts that give the reason is shown. The actual
   pending reason messages appear from most to least common.
.sp 2
*  3: Displays categorized host-based pending reasons for both
   candidate and non-candidate hosts in the cluster. For both the
   candidate and non-candidate hosts, the actual pending reason
   on each host is shown. For each pending reason, the number of
   hosts that show that reason is given. The actual reason
   messages appear from most to least common.
.sp 2
If no level is specified, the default is shown, as set by the
\fRLSB_BJOBS_PENDREASON_LEVEL\fR parameter in the lsf.conf file.
.sp 2
If global limits are enabled (that is, the \fBGLOBAL_LIMITS\fR
parameter is enabled in the lsb.params file and global limits are
defined in the lsb.globalpolicies file), the pending reason also
includes the total global limit amount for the resource
allocation limit in the \fRGlobal\fR field if the job is blocked
by the global limit value and the existing \fRLimit Value\fR
field is a dynamically changing number that is taken from the
global limits. In addition, the format of the job group name
changes to "\fR/\fIjob_group\fR/@\fIcluster\fR\fR" to show the
cluster name.
.sp 2
With IBM Spectrum LSF License Scheduler (LSF License Scheduler),
the pending reason also includes the project name for project
mode and the cluster name for cluster mode features. Jobs with an
invalid project name show the project name as a hyphen (\fR-\fR).
If a default project is configured for that feature, it shows
\fRdefault\fR as the project name.
.sp 2
If -l is also specified, the pending reason shows the names of
the hosts and any hosts that are on the job\(aqs host exclusion
list.
.sp 2
With the LSF multicluster capability, -l shows the names of hosts
in the local cluster.
.sp 2
Each pending reason is associated with one or more hosts and it
states the cause why these hosts are not allocated to run the
job. In situations where the job requests specific hosts (using
bsub -m), users may see reasons for unrelated hosts also being
displayed, together with the reasons associated with the
requested hosts.
.sp 2
In the case of host-based pre-execution failure, pending reasons
will be displayed.
.sp 2
The life cycle of a pending reason ends after the time indicated
by \fBPEND_REASON_UPDATE_INTERVAL\fR in lsb.params.
.sp 2
When the job slot limit is reached for a job array (bsub -J
"jobArray[indexList]%job_slot_limit") the following message is
displayed:
.sp 2
\fRThe job array has reached its job slot limit.\fR

job that is eligible for scheduling and will be run if there are
sufficient resources to run it.
.sp 2
An ineligible pending job remains pending even if there are
enough resources to run it and is therefore ineligible for
scheduling. Reasons for a job to remain pending, and therefore be
in an ineligible pending state, include the following:
.sp 2
*  The job has a start time constraint (specified with the -b
   option)
.sp 2
*  The job is suspended while pending (in a PSUSP state).
.sp 2
*  The queue of the job is made inactive by the administrator or
   by its time window.
.sp 2
*  The job\(aqs dependency conditions are not satisfied.
.sp 2
*  The job cannot fit into the run time window (\fBRUN_WINDOW\fR)
.sp 2
*  Delayed scheduling is enabled for the job
   (\fBNEW_JOB_SCHED_DELAY\fR is greater than zero)
.sp 2
*  The job\(aqs queue or application profile does not exist.

option is specified for a specific user, user group, or all users
(using the all keyword), pending jobs of the specific users are
summarized. The \fBSECURE_JOB_INFO_LEVEL\fR parameter can define
different access control levels for all users. The -psum option
will only summarize the pending jobs that can be seen by the

.sp 2
If you use -A, specify job array IDs without the index list.
.sp 2
In LSF multicluster capability job forwarding mode, you can use
the local job ID and cluster name to retrieve the job details
from the remote cluster. The query syntax is:

For job arrays, the query syntax is:

\fRbjobs

.sp 2
The advantage of using submission_job_id@submission_cluster_name
instead of bjobs -l job_id is that you can use
submission_job_id@submission_cluster_name as an alias to query a
local job in the execution cluster without knowing the local job
ID in the execution cluster. The bjobs output is identical no

.SH Output: Default Display

.sp 2
Pending jobs are displayed in the order in which they are
considered for dispatch. Jobs in higher priority queues are
displayed before those in lower priority queues. Pending jobs in
the same priority queues are displayed in the order in which they
were submitted but this order can be changed by using the
commands btop or bbot. If more than one job is dispatched to a
host, the jobs on that host are listed in the order in which they
are considered for scheduling on this host by their queue
priorities and dispatch times. Finished jobs are displayed in the
order in which they were completed.
.sp 2
A listing of jobs is displayed with the following fields:
.sp 2
\fBJOBID \fR

         The job ID that LSF assigned to the job.
.sp 2
\fBUSER\fR
.br
         The user who submitted the job.
.sp 2
\fBSTAT\fR
.br
         The current status of the job (see JOB STATUS below).
.sp 2
\fBQUEUE\fR
.br
         The name of the job queue to which the job belongs. If
         the queue to which the job belongs has been removed from
         the configuration, the queue name is displayed as
         \fRlost_and_found\fR. Use bhist to get the original
         queue name. Jobs in the \fRlost_and_found\fR queue
         remain pending until they are switched with the bswitch
         command into another queue.
.sp 2
         In a LSF multicluster capability resource leasing
         environment, jobs scheduled by the consumer cluster
         display the remote queue name in the format
         \fIqueue_name\fR@\fIcluster_name\fR. By default, this
         field truncates at 10 characters, so you might not see
         the cluster name unless you use -w or -l.
.sp 2
\fBFROM_HOST\fR
.br
         The name of the host from which the job was submitted.
.sp 2
         With the LSF multicluster capability, if the host is in
         a remote cluster, the cluster name and remote job ID are
         appended to the host name, in the format
         \fIhost_name\fR@\fIcluster_name\fR:\fIjob_ID\fR. By
         default, this field truncates at 11 characters; you
         might not see the cluster name and job ID unless you use
         -w or -l.
.sp 2
\fBEXEC_HOST\fR
.br
         The name of one or more hosts on which the job is
         executing (this field is empty if the job has not been
         dispatched). If the host on which the job is running has
         been removed from the configuration, the host name is
         displayed as \fRlost_and_found\fR. Use bhist to get the
         original host name.
.sp 2
         If the host is part of a condensed host group or compute
         unit, the host name is displayed as the name of the
         condensed group.
.sp 2
         If you configure a host to belong to more than one
         condensed host groups using wildcards, bjobs can display
         any of the host groups as execution host name.
.sp 2
\fBJOB_NAME \fR
.br
         The job name assigned by the user, or the command string
         assigned by default at job submission with bsub. If the

         latter part of the job name is displayed.
.sp 2
         The displayed job name or job command can contain up to
         4094 characters for UNIX, or up to 255 characters for

.sp 2
         \fBPEND \fR
.br
                  The job is pending. That is, it has not yet
                  been started.
.sp 2
         \fBPROV\fR
.br
                  The job has been dispatched to a power-saved

                  sent to the sbatchd, it is in a PROV state.
.sp 2
         \fBPSUSP\fR
.br
                  The job has been suspended, either by its owner

.sp 2
         \fBSSUSP\fR
.br
                  The job has been suspended by LSF. The
                  following are examples of why LSF suspended the
                  job:
.sp 2
                  *  The load conditions on the execution host or
                     hosts have exceeded a threshold according to
                     the \fRloadStop\fR vector defined for the

.br
                  The job has terminated with status of 0.
.sp 2
         \fBEXIT\fR
.br
                  The job has terminated with a non-zero status –
                  it may have been aborted due to an error in its
                  execution, or killed by its owner or the LSF
                  administrator.
.sp 2
                  For example, exit code 131 means that the job
                  exceeded a configured resource usage limit and
                  LSF killed the job.
.sp 2
         \fBUNKWN\fR
.br
                  mbatchd has lost contact with the sbatchd on

                  For jobs submitted to a chunk job queue,
                  members of a chunk job that are waiting to run.
.sp 2
         \fBZOMBI\fR
.br
                  A job becomes ZOMBI if:
.sp 2
                  *  A non-rerunnable job is killed by bkill
                     while the sbatchd on the execution host is
                     unreachable and the job is shown as UNKWN.
.sp 2
                  *  After the execution host becomes available,
                     LSF tries to kill the ZOMBI job. Upon
                     successful termination of the ZOMBI job, the
                     job\(aqs status is changed to EXIT.
.sp 2
                     With the LSF multicluster capability, when a
                     job running on a remote execution cluster
                     becomes a ZOMBI job, the execution cluster
                     treats the job the same way as local ZOMBI
                     jobs. In addition, it notifies the
                     submission cluster that the job is in ZOMBI
                     state and the submission cluster requeues

                  resident memory usage of all processes in a job
                  running on a host. The sum of host-based rusage
                  may not equal the total job rusage, since total

.sp 2
                  Memory usage unit is scaled automatically based

                     set size (RSS) is subtracted from the
                     virtual memory usage. RSS is the portion of
                     memory occupied by a process that is held in
                     main memory. Swap usage is collected as the

         \fR3/0/5/12\fR represents an allocation to thread 12 in
         core 5 of socket 0 in NUMA node 3. A string of the form
         \fR2/1/4\fRrepresents an allocation to core 4 of socket
         1 in NUMA node 2. The integers correspond to the node ID
         numbers displayed in the topology tree from bhosts -aff.
