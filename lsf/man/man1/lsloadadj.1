.SH Synopsis

.sp 2
\fBlsloadadj\fR [\fB-R\fR res_req] [host_name[\fB:\fRnum_task]
 ...]
.sp 2
\fBlsloadadj\fR [\fB-h\fR | \fB-V\fR]
.SH Description

.sp 2
Adjusts load indices on hosts. This is useful if a task placement
decision is made outside LIM by another application.
.sp 2
By default, assumes tasks are CPU-intensive and memory-intensive.
This means the CPU and memory load indices are adjusted to a
higher number than other load indices.
.sp 2
By default, adjusts load indices on the local host, the host from
which the command was submitted.
.sp 2
By default, starts 1 task.
.sp 2
Upon receiving a load adjustment request, LIM temporarily
increases the load on hosts according to resource requirements.
This helps LIM avoid sending too many jobs to the same host in
quick succession. The adjusted load decays over time before the
real load produced by the dispatched task is reflected in LIMâ€™s
load information.
.sp 2
The lsloadadj command adjusts all indices except for \fRls\fR
(login sessions), \fRit\fR (idle time), \fRr15m\fR (15 minute run
queue length) and external load indices. Other load indices can
only be adjusted beyond specific maximum values.

.SH Options

.sp 2
\fB-R \fIres_req\fB\fR
.br
         Specify resource requirements for tasks. Only the
         resource usage (\fRrusage\fR) section of the resource
         requirement string is considered. This is used by LIM to
         determine by how much individual load indices are to be
         adjusted.
.sp 2
         For example, if a task is swap-space-intensive, load
         adjustment on the \fRswp\fR load index is higher; other
         indices are increased only slightly.
.sp 2
\fB\fIhost_name\fB[:\fInum_task\fB] ... \fR
.br
         Specify a list of hosts for which load is to be
         adjusted. num_task indicates the number of tasks to be
         started on the host.
.sp 2
\fB-h \fR
.br
         Prints command usage to stderr and exits.
.sp 2
\fB-V \fR
.br
         Prints LSF release version to stderr and exits.
.SH Examples

.sp 2
\fRlsloadadj -R "rusage[swp=20:mem=10]"\fR
.sp 2
Adjusts the load indices \fRswp\fR and \fRmem\fR on the host from
which the command was submitted.
.SH Diagnostics

.sp 2
Returns -1 if an invalid parameter is specified; otherwise
returns 0.
