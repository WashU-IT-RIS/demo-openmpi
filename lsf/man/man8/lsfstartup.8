.SH Description

.sp 2
\fBImportant: \fRThis command can be used only by root or users
who are listed in the lsf.sudoers file.
.sp 2
Starts the LIM, RES, and sbatchd daemons, in that order, on all
hosts. When live configuration with the bconf command is enabled
(the \fBLSF_LIVE_CONFDIR\fR parameter is defined in the lsf.conf
file), the lsfstartup command uses configuration files that are
generated by the bconf command.
.sp 2
By default, prompts for confirmation of the next operation if an
error is encountered.
.sp 2
If LSF daemons are already running, use the lsfrestart command
instead, or use the lsfshutdown to shut down the running daemons
before you use the lsfstartup command.
.sp 2
To be able to control all daemons in the cluster, the file
/etc/lsf.sudoers must be set up properly.
.sp 2
\fBNote: \fRTo use the lsf.sudoers file, you must enable the
setuid bit for the LSF administration commands. Run the hostsetup
--setuid command option on the LSF management and candidate
hosts. Since this allows LSF administration commands to run with
root privileges, do not enable the setuid bit if you do not want
these LSF commands to run with root privileges.
.sp 2
The hostsetup --setuid command enables the setuid bit for the
following LSF executable files: badmin, lsadmin, egosh, utmpreg,
swtbl_api, ntbl_api, lstbl_nid, and swtbl_poe.
