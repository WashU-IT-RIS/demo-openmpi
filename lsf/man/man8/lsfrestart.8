.SH Description

.sp 2
\fBImportant: \fR
.sp 2
This command can be used only by root, the primary cluster
administrator, or users who are listed in the lsf.sudoers file.
.sp 2
Restarts the LIM, RES, sbatchd and mbatchd daemons, in that
order, on all hosts in the local cluster. When live configuration
with the bconf command is enabled (the \fBLSF_LIVE_CONFDIR\fR
parameter is defined in the lsf.conf file), the lsfstartup
command uses configuration files that are generated by the bconf
command.
.sp 2
By default, prompts for confirmation of the next operation if an
error is encountered.
.sp 2
To be able to control all daemons in the cluster, the file
/etc/lsf.sudoers must be set up properly.
.sp 2
\fBNote: \fRTo use the lsf.sudoers file, you must enable the
setuid bit for the LSF administration commands. Run the hostsetup
--setuid command option on the LSF management and candidate
hosts. Since this allows LSF administration commands to run with
root privileges, do not enable the setuid bit if you do not want
these LSF commands to run with root privileges.
.sp 2
The hostsetup --setuid command enables the setuid bit for the
following LSF executable files: badmin, lsadmin, egosh, utmpreg,
swtbl_api, ntbl_api, lstbl_nid, and swtbl_poe.
